1/1	"The vaccine is slightly safer than getting the illness" is a poor argument. No one is making that argument. The vaccine is exponentially safer than getting the illness. From a mortality perspective, even if we count cases where the vaccine could be listed as a secondary cause, the mortality rate is ~7 per million. For comparison, the COVID mortality rate in the US alone as of September is 2099 per million. That’s about 300 times more lethal than the vaccine.

1/-1	1. Immunity takes time. 2. The vaccine is effective, but not 100%. 3. It's unclear how long immunity lasts. 4. Whether someone who has been vaccinated can still infect others is unknown
1/1	1. People get vaccinated. 2. Less people in hospital. 3. Panic is over.
0/-1	1. The peer-reviewed medical studies on the efficacy of masks at preventing the transmission of viruses all conclude that-- They Do Not. 2. The CDC's PCR testing amplification cycles were set to 40 cycles and at 33 cycles, they still couldn't detect any live virus, meaning that there were MILLIONS of false positives. 3. Looking at the way the numbers were collected, analyzed and reported-- I realized that it's asinine to lend any credibility to any of them, as their failure to collect relevant data has fatally flawed the ability to have an accurate account that meets any sort of unbiased scientific standard, making the data-- by definition-- unreliable. 4. "People that are asymptomatic can spread the virus while appearing healthy". Seems to be the concept driving mask mandates, however; Asymptomatic individuals have NEVER been the drivers of Outbreaks, Epidemics, nor Pandemics-- EVER, in the history of airborne viruses of ANY type. I'm not aware of any conclusive unbiased data which shows the breakdown of the transmission rate of asymptomatic SARS-covid2, c19, influenza, swine flu, bird flu or any other... relative to being the driver of an outbreak that rises to the level of an epidemic or a pandemic. Link? Crickets... 5. We've had flu vaccines for decades and the flu and flu deaths are still with us-- And, we didn't have lockdowns and mask mandates for that and we shouldn't for the same reason with this, Especially considering that the current treatment has a success rate of 99.7%. Panic over .3% is the act of someone who's unhinged and bordering on Paranoid hysteria
0/-1	1. This isn’t a “vaccine.” And 2. This experimental drug doesn’t stop the spread of the virus.
1/1	1. We knew from the start that the mRNA vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing infection, and knew that this would decrease with mutations. 2. We knew from the start that the mRNA vaccines wouldn’t prevent transmission, but that they would decrease infections, symptoms, and recovery time… which would decrease transmission. 3. Both of the above were critical to ensure our hospitals weren’t overrun by people being placed on ventilators and requiring other treatments.
0/0	1. these are not vaccines, they are experimental mrna and dna gene therapy. 2. they were approved under emergency authorization and haven't been properly tested. 3. anyone taking this experimental gene therapy will be test subjects.

1/1	100% true and real. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from covid. 19. Rather than getting infected by the virus. Due to ignorance so many citizens are falling infected under covid.19 and experiencing difficulties. So to avoid such inconvenience its much more better to take a vaccine two doses for avoiding risk of Corona. Don't believe such innocent persons beliefs and take vaccine atonce.please.

0/0	14 obvious crucial questions about the Covid vaccines “They” originally promised the only way back to “normal” was a vaccine for coronavirus. “They” obviously lied. Fri Jan 29, 2021 - 8:26 pm EST January 29, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) - According to the government... If I get vaccinated: 1.- Can I stop wearing the mask? Government Response - No 2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc and everyone work normally? Government Response - No 3.- Will I be resistant to covid? Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it 4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore? Government Response - No you can still pass it on, possibly, nobody knows. 5.- If we vaccinate all children, will school resume normally? Government Response - No 6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? Government Response - No 7.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? Government Response - No 8.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandfather, can we hug each other? Government Response - No 9.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums be reopened thanks to vaccines? Government Response - No 10.- Will the vaccinated be able to gather? Government Response - No 11.- What is the real benefit of vaccination? Government Response - The virus won't kill you. 12.- Are you sure it won't kill me? Government Response - No 13.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway ... Why would I get vaccinated?" Government Response - To protect others. 14.- So if I get vaccinated, the others are 100% sure I'm not infecting them? Government Response - No So to summarize, the Covid19 vaccine... Does not give immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. Does not prevent death. Does not guarantee you won’t get it. Does not prevent you from getting it. Does not stop you passing it on Does not eliminate the need for travel bans. Does not eliminate the need for business closures. Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns. Does not eliminate the need for masking. So...what is it actually doing? You haven’t forgotten that “they” originally promised the only way back to “normal” was a vaccine for coronavirus. “They” obviously lied. In addition, a number of prominent leaders have lately been insisting there will be no return to normal. They are now very open about saying that everything has permanently changed to a “new normal.” Klaus Schwab – founder of the World Economic Forum – makes it very clear in this excerpt from a talk by him. Everything that we are going through right now, including very dangerous, catastrophic lockdowns, will remain with us forever. Dr. Simone Gold talk below) that are not allowed to be used, is their excuse for this dramatic, imposed change on the entire world population for a virus and for the large majority of the population. Their supposed solution of the “experimental” covid vaccine, as you can see from the above list, is not really a medical solution at all. It is not only not effective, it is increasingly looking to be unusually dangerous for an alleged “vaccine”, which it is not. Dr. Gold has recently given one of the best talks to date on the virus and dangers of the “experimental” vaccines. Everyone should watch this talk. It should be promoted around the world. So, again, what is the real purpose of these vaccines? They have already told us – control of everyone to impose a New World Order/4th Industrial Revolution. We will all be required to have a vaccine passport or digital proof of vaccine, just as in Communist China, in order to enjoy already God-given rights and freedoms. Democracy and national sovereignty will be taken away and replaced by rule by a small, very powerful and wealthy elite. Everyone needs to stop watching all television and newspaper news and actively organize to oppose this world tyranny. Anyone who believes any of their propaganda and goes along with it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.

"It won't stop you from getting Covid-19, it won't stop you from spreading Covid-19." So will somebody please explain how it can be seen as "highly effective". It's highly effective at making certain people extremely wealthy, but what else? Take a look at Britain's latest re-hospitalization figures for Covid-19 infection, for people who have been double-vaxxed. The official figures reveal, it's the worst it's ever been and getting worse! So the myth about the reduction of hospitalizations after vaccination has been blown off its pedestal by the blunt facts.

1	1st dose in March, second in April. Have been exposed multiple times to COVID-19 and haven't developed an infection thanks to this. I will be getting the booster. For those writing immediately afterward with aches/pains: it was similar to when you get a Flu shot and passes shortly. I have not experienced any lingering effects and the short term sluggishness is well worth it for the protection I get and dramatically reduce any severe reaction if I were to have a breakthrough infection. I imagine there's a political motive behind many of these negative reviews.

1/1	@Marcos Aurélio If you don’t take the vaccine and get infected, you’re giving the virus another chance to mutate towards something new that the vaccine can’t protect other vaccinated people from. If the new virus that evolves in your body spreads again, the pharmaceutical company won’t have readily studied vaccine against it. In another sentence, the vaccine would be outdated, if there’s such a mutation. Therefore, by not taking the vaccine, you could be aiding the virus in its evolution and forcing everyone to go through the pandemic again. I hope this answers your questions.
0/-1	@MarcusTriton I've asked before, if you're sick from the vaccine, (like my neighbours were) are you a danger to me? I know as many people who got sick from the vaccine as from covid. Whether they really are contagious, who knows...perhaps the current human trials will tell us.

1/1	@Sacks at 1:07:30 you say “how did it make any difference whatsoever?” The chart they showed earlier on reduction of hospital visits and deaths related to the vaccine unquestionably saved 100ks of lives. You’re right, it’s not a vaccine by definition, and that the long tail here needs to be scrutinized on an individual basis (boosters vs less severe strains), but you should responsibly admit that vaccines saved lives initially. There’s a world where you admit that they made an enormous difference, but also that the Pfizer and Moderna CEOs need to be investigated. This is where I sit, as a liberal, for what it’s worth.
1/1	@SalSports 6/ So when someone says "it's my RIGHT to not wear a mask" or "it's my right not to get vaccinated" because the stadium is owned by the taxpayers - they are being a hypocrite, maybe unknowingly because their health insurance is also owned by the taxpayers or policy holders... Out of 56M . Don’t check what your odds are to be struck by lightning or have a condom fail or fall down an open mine. They are all higher than the potential to get Covid after your vaccinated .

1/1	A great challenge, this is the time for human beings to show their capacity to think about the collective, to show that we still have a chance to change for the better. In Brazil politicians still need to learn a lot.
0/0	A greater percentage of the world has moved on dear. Stop drawing us backwards with your vaccines.
1/1	A growing body of evidence shows that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. CDC recommends an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) in most circumstances based on an updated risk-benefit analysis.

1/1	A known medical exemption including but not limited to allergies to any of the ingredients of the vaccine and a religious exemption providing that the individual is a member in good standing with an established faith tradition that eschews various medical interventions. Your individual beliefs independent of such a religious body would not count, as there would be too much room to abuse that. Otherwise, no. get the shot, and quit looking for excuses. The virus should scare you infinitely more than the vaccine.

1/1	A late birthday present yesterday, first instalment of covid vaccine. No pain, no side effects, just lingering concern that I got called because someone else failed to show. Get the vaccination folks.
0/0	A lifetime business, I knew it, annual vaccination, they won't find a cure because it's not good business to eliminate the virus completely, but an annual vaccine is good business, and what's one's life expectancy with the unexpected side effects of the vaccine now that it's regular annual?
0/0	A little late, now that BILLIONS have taken it. We are lead by idiots.
1	A little more hope. This is good news. Now we just need everyone to do this properly, wear a mask, keep your distance and only go out/do things of you really have to. If we all pulled together from the start we may not have been in the position we are now. Stay safe everyone

0/0	A lot of parents are going to find out what ZERO LIABILITY means the hard way unfortunately!
1/1	A lot of people are being sarcastic about the vaccine, but shortly there will be real benefits to taking it, such as convenience in international travel (immunity to quarantines), not to mention if you go on business trips to China, your company will likely require you to take the vaccine anyway. You'll know what I'm talking about if you work at an international company.
1/1	A lot of people aren't at risk of dying from the flu, but we tend to get flu shots. It helps those that ARE at risk and also happen to fit in the small percentage where the vaccine doesn't work.
1/1	A lot of people at my school are against the vaccine. It feels good to be one of the few that’s getting it.
1/1	A lot of people can not get the vaccine because they live in poors countries, stop be ingrates and take the vaccine that the governament PAYS for you
1/1	A lot of people don't think past themselves, the mentality "It's not gonna hurt/affect me so why should I care" is just terrible. This mentality applies to other things too and its sad.
1/1	A lot of people don’t understand that’s the way to get rid of these horrible viruses, creating heard immunity is the best thing that we can do. We have to vaccinate ourselves in order to protect the ones that can’t get vaccinated.

0/-1	A lot of people just don't like having things shoved down their throats without their consent.
1/-1	A lot of people know or think this covid 19 vaccination is painful is because of other type of vaccinations like for example the vaccination for the little children when they are 3, 4, 5, or 6 months old so they won't get a virus, sickness or infection. the little children vaccination hurts or feel painful when these children get it and if you want to know because of other type of vaccinations that is not for covid 19 people really think is painful , so people are not getting a covid 19 vaccination that easy
0/0	A lot of people regret it now. Look at all the latest answers. Full of healthy people who were forced to get the shot and now have certain diseases. Insult to injury - they weren’t even ever at high risk for the virus in the first place. This whole one-size-fits-all approach has failed miserably. We, the “dirty anti-vaxxers” as you’ve all been calling us, were screaming these truths from the rooftops years ago, but you all called us conspiracy theorists. I don’t feel sorry for you, however I DO feel sorry for those that were forced to get the vaccines - forced by the mandates that YOU people supported.
1/1/1	A lot of people seem to understand vaccination as *only* personal protection, when in fact it is *mostly* societal protection.
1/1	A lot of people who are against the vaccine are like "I cannot trust the people who encourage you to take it" and I always respond with "Then do you know more than medical professionals?" because the only people who are against the vaccines are not doctors.
1/1	A lot of these diseases were eradicated until the most recent dangerous trend of not vaccinating kids, and cases of measles were reported in the US.
1/1	A lot of this went over my head. However, I appreciate that you are sticking to facts based on scientific study instead of emotional arguments.
0/0	A lot of truckers just had a protest against the vaccine. I'm hoping my fellow truckers stay consistent. I'm going to say no to the company I work for.

0/0	A massive experiment on the human race
1/1	A massive thank you to all the scientists & boffins who have come up with this vaccine so quickly!
0/0	A measles vaccine prevents measles and that’s effective. How can COVID be considered a vaccine when it takes multiple boosters? It’s like a flu shot but it does not eradicate a disease.
1/1	A medical professional who opposes vaccination violates her, his or their professional knowledge to a degree that it puts that professional competence into question! It stands to reason to ask wether that person opposes other medical standards like disinfection before medical procedures. It would be prudent to monitor such staff for adherence to prescribed medications and medical treatments of patients. There is a decisive difference between freedom of choice and harmful incompetence!
0/0	A member of the elected London Assembly, David Kurten, recently tweeted that there is a "serious concern" that the COVID-19 vaccine could make women sterile.
1/1	A mere, harmless ASPIRIN can be dangerous to a few people. Still billions of aspirins are taken every day. The same goes for ALL medicines, for all vaccines. The world is getting more and more ignorant...

0/0	A neighbour who was totally healthy farmer out every day, we tried to stop him getting vaxed , he got it, took clots, seen him hobbling about and had word. He was took in and had to have injections to dissolve the clots on the lungs . Looks terribly I’ll. What can you do?
0/0	A never ending road of vaccine boosters until we stop the madness
1/-1	A new anti-vaccine strategy is to pretend that they have the power to make officials personally liable for imposing public health restrictions, like masks and vaccines, in public schools. They are wrong. They don't have that power.

1/1	A new study from the Netherlands shows that COVID-19 patients who went to the ICU exhibit physical, mental, and cognitive effects after one year. Anyone who trivializes this disease fails to see what may happen with long COVID. More reasons to get vaccinated.
0/1	A new study suggests that most COVID symptoms are caused by mass hysteria.

0/1	A quick peek at “Scientific American,” tells me that the best guess is, the average human being carries something like 380 trillion viruses at any given moment, and that they’re very possibly essential to keeping us alive and healthy. For one thing, a lot of ‘em eat dangerous bacteria. So I dunno how you manage not to have any on board—I suspect angels?—but it’s kind of a silly claim. Fact is, we’re a lot like a good healthy jungle: a home for all sorts kf happy little critters. Sorry.
0/-1	A rapid heartbeat was one of the side effects I had after getting the vaccine.
0/0	A really healthy person does not need to “rake” any covid “vaccine” concoction, those intended to possibly help the 1.6% of all infected, those with weakened natural immune systems that died anyway…
1/1	A recently conducted prison study confirms the benefits of vaccination to reduce but not eliminate transmission.
0/0/0	A rushed vaccine, no thanks
0/0/0/0/0	A safe vaccine usually takes up to 15 years to develop. Long term side effects which may only occur years later need to be studied first.
1/1	A safer summer starts with a #CovidVaccine. Ty recently got his second dose and he is ready to play basketball again. With fewer restrictions in Contra Costa, you might be wondering what that means.
1/1	A scientist says that the vaccine that he knows a lot about is both proved safe and effective in clinical trials. And those trials are both open and transparent. He can even sometimes give you an on-line reference that gives the details.
0/0	A severe allergic reaction, like anaphylaxis, may happen after any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	A shame we have to wait six months to get it, but good news regardless.
1/1	A side effect I get from any vaccine is a high fever. But I’d much rather get a fever than the actual disease
1/1	A significant feature is... it is a single dose vaccine.. which will make vaccination campaign wide spread and relatively comfortable to do. Will add impetus to our war on pandemic .
1/1	A simple rule: love your vaccine, take it everytime they ask you to, wear as much masks as it possible to do it at once and stay self isolated forever. We can safe this world and become heroes for upcoming generations!
1/1	A single person is statistically “no one.” I’m not minimizing your relative, but people have reactions to vaccines, yes. And vaccines save lives.
1/1	A sleepless night with chills and fever and a very sore arm means the vaccine is working. Is it fun? No. But will the orgy I get to have in a month or so? Yes.
1/1	A slight headache and a bit of brain fog kicking earlier this afternoon with the second shot. A lot better than getting full on COVID-19.
1	A slight risk? Covid has more than a slight risk of heart problems. My uncle aged 82 just died of a heart attack caused by covid and an underlying condition. I’ll take the vaccine, thank you.
1/1	A small hole in his argument here, he’s basing his reasoning for not getting the jab on the data not being up to date with the current variant, but even if he’s right, what happened in the time before when he was practicing without the vaccine and delta was prevalent, wasn’t it irresponsible not to get the jab then?

0/0	A true vaccine prevents you getting the disease you are vaccinated against. The covid shot at best reduce severity of symptoms, but do not prevent disease spread
1/1/1	A vaccinated child is better than a dead child, for all those wonderful angry people
1/1	A vaccinated person can heave a big sigh of relief for the reason that at least for a year he can be free from getting infected. He/she would feel and experience a big burden getting off-loaded. This feeling is infectious as others too get a confidence, a boost and need not be worried or bothered about close interactions or indulging in activities with such persons. This way the spread can be put on a right leash. A stitch in time saves nine.

0/0	A vaccine a preparation containing live, attenuated or inactivated (killed) microorganisms (or some part or product of them), that is used to stimulate an IMMUNE RESPONSE in the recipient, which gains IMMUNITY. Only due to the state of "emergency" are these allow to be called vaccine. There is no proof that either of these do either. Who will take the blame for all these deaths for with holding HCQ from us?? Follow the money!!
0/0	A vaccine against something that doesn't exist .... oh dear we are getting desperate
1	A vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. No vaccine contains a complete form of the virus responsible for this illness. While their body builds immunity, it is normal for a person to experience minor side effects.
0/0	A vaccine conceived, developed, tested and approved in less than a year--what could possibly go wrong?
0/0	A vaccine court would not exist if vaccines were totally safe.
1/0	A vaccine does not only prevent severity. Ie there is no vaccine that does not effect cases but makes the cases less sick only. For example this would never happen.2 groups of 1000 people one getting vaccine and the other not. Both groups show 100 cases of the viral illness. IE no difference in prevention. But those 100 who got the vaccine are less sick. So cases aren't prevented only severity.No vaccine works this way. Vaccines prevent infection. Although we do look at hospitalization and death prevention sometimes because that's what we want to vaccine to prevent. However of it does prevent severity of world have to do so by preventing cases too.A vaccine does not circulate through the body like an antibiotic that treats the illness if you happen to catch it. That's not a thing.

1/0	A vaccine would be a good start to stop the spread, but in the meantime we need a treatment to mitigate the affects the virus has on the body. What gets me is the number of people that catch the COVID19 virus and do just fine or the people that catch the virus but never show any signs.

1/-1	A vaccines efficacy rate is calculated in large clinical trials, when the vaccine is tested on tens of thousands of people,those people are broken into two groups: half gets the vaccine and half get a placebo. Then , they are sent out to live their lives, while scientists monitor whether or not they get covid-19 over several months, and how those people fall into each of these groups determines a vaccines efficacy.

0/-1	Abortion: Ofc its your choice Vaccine: Take this untested vaccine, or else
1/1	About 192 Million of us are vaccinated, only the republicans are the hold-outs 138 million [unvaccinated] causing the problems
1/1	About 60 million eligible people in the US still haven't had their first vaccine dose and are at higher risk of severe illness and death from a Covid infection. The more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL be and the less disruption we'll continue to face.
1/1	About 96% of all physicians are fully vaccinated. So, at most, 4% oppose vaccines. Suppose you were contemplating surgery and 96% of the physicians you consulted told you you would die without it but 4% told you you’d be fine. How many of these people would listen to the 4%?
0/0	About a minute in, you figure out this is propaganda..

0/0	Absolute Bullshit. They didn't do any of the Testing that they would normally do for a Vaccine.
0/0	Absolute not. I'd possibly concede to the vaccine myself but no way I'd put my child into a trial for a vaccine for a disease that doesn't hurt them. Although I guess if my kid was super keen for some reason and I thought they were legit. https://t.co/knARXv2Zwj

1/1	Absolutely getting the vaccine. Here's why: I understand how it works, I know it doesn't contain ANY virus & therefore can't infect me, it won't change my DNA, & they're not implanting an RFID chip. Pfizer & Moderna were tested on 74K ppl, & millions more have been vaxxed safely.

0/0	Absolutely no need for young healthy people to take this vaccine, none whatsoever. I will absolutely NOT be told that I need to take something against my will
0/0	Absolutely no way I would get that, especially not if I was pregnant! So many babies have been lost, 2 pregnant doctors lost their pregnancies
0/-1	Absolutely not or pregnant woman! Nor babies!
0/0	Absolutely not! I would NEVER take it.
0/0	Absolutely not. Although SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a slightly nastier virus than usual, it’s not anything to panic about. The world has gone absolutely nuts about this, but if you study the science, dig into the situation, you’ll realize that what we have is panic and not a dangerous virus that calls for extreme measures. The “cure” has been far, far, far worse than the disease.
0/0	Absolutely not. I don’t get flu shots, pneumonia vaccines, or anything else, either. I never get the flu, but everyone I know who gets a flu shot ends up with the flu. And I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and have no idea what havoc the vaccine might cause in my body. Besides, I’ve had COVID already and it wasn’t that big of a deal.
0/0	Absolutely not. Not a wise decision. People need to wise up and do their due diligence. Turn off the programming and ask themselves some questions. Like: why would anyone trust ANY of those people in ANY situation? They absolutely do NOT have our best interest at heart. They want to bring the population down to less than 5% of what it is now and THEY'VE TOLD US SO. WAKE UP! .

0/0	Absolutely not. Not unless they force me too. I will not take a vaccine with an MRNA component on moral grounds. I am allergic to some of the components. I react to even a flu vaccine.
1/1	Absolutely nothing to do with vaccines. Just one more lie being propagated by anti vaccine whack jobs.
0/0	Absolutely unbelievable that vaccine passports are even being considered for experimental vaccines that have not been tested on the long-term; and will not be ready for protocol approval until 2023! Irresponsible. People are so desperate to get on with their lives that they are willing get a vaccine and not necessarily for their health, but for ther freedom!
1/-1	Absolutely yes. If there were substantial negative side effects we’d have seen them by now. That’s what such extensive trials are for.
1/1	Absolutely zero side effects from the 4 Pfizer shots. But that two shit shingles vaccine? Now 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 was terrible!
1/1	Absolutely!! Thank you for looking out for healthcare professionals, CDC! Pharmacists have been excitedly getting vaccinated!
1/1	Absolutely, yes!Vaccines are probably the single greatest advance in preventative medicine ever made by the human race. Furthermore, they are getting safer and safer. Vaccines that don’t even contain a whole pathogen, dead or alive, are an awesome advance.
1	Absolutely, you should have the vaccine ! I’m a Covid Survivor (April 2020) in hospital for 30 days and in ICU 17 days. I’m still considered disabled because of short term memory loss, PTSD, depression, anxiety and several other problems. They didn’t have the vaccine yet! I have since gotten both of them and will get the booster.
1/1/1	Absolutely. As soon as I can.The vaccine manufacturers have exercised great caution and subjected the vaccines to intense third party unbiased testing and review. The test data are extremely impressive and the good the vaccines will bring is far beyond the risks.
1/-1	Absolutely. Easy choice.
1/1	Absolutely. I and the hundreds of vaxxed people I know are all dead too.
1/1/1/1	Absolutely. I don't want to contract Covid, nor do I want to be spreading it around. I will take the vaccine gladly, as often as needed.
0/0	Absolutely. Wait until you find out the vax wasn’t made to help you . It was made to kill you
1/1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60’s. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population
1/-1	Absolutely.I am male and I am in my 60’s. I am in one of the highest risk groups in the population.
1/1	Absolutely~!! The vaccine development was moving faster than normal because the scientific community made it their top priority all over the world! Thank you for protecting American lives, CDC!
1/0	Absurd. Only people who aren’t vaccinated are getting hospitalized. Quit punishing the smart ones.
1/1	According to CDC website: "Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential spread the virus to others, although AT MUCH LOWER RATES than unvaccinated people.
0/0	According to Part 19 of Fall of the Cabal, the virus is a hoax whose cells cannot be isolated. The fact that all we can see are drawings only proves this. It is a flu and all this was planned all along.
1/-1	According to a CNN article: "In Moderna's trial, 15,000 study participants were given a placebo, which is a shot of saline that has no effect. Over several months, 90 of them developed Covid-19, with 11 developing severe forms of the disease. Another 15,000 participants were given the vaccine, and only five of them developed Covid-19. None of the five became severely ill." I do not know much about about vaccines, but that seems absolutely amazing.

0/0	According to a recent Rasmussen poll, about 73 million Americans believe they know someone personally who died from the COVID jabs.
0/-1	According to company data” which means that it’s not a reliable source.
0	According to epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, as more seniors receive their first covid shots, many will inevitably suffer from unrelated heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems — not because of the vaccine, but rather because of their age and declining health.
1/1/1/1	According to health experts, there could be regular side effects expected after a vaccination, such as muscle aches. But similar to other types of vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines undergo trials and testing involving thousands of volunteers...
0/0	According to history vaccines don't work. When I came to this country I had to be vaccinated did it work? no, not even the flu shot works just to make money. One day judgement day will come when God judges all these greedy politicians.
0/0/0	According to lib science there's 969 genders and men can have menstrual periods. I am Not going to trust their "science."
1/1	According to research it's safe to take the vaccine
1/1	According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "most childhood immunizations are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease."
1/1	According to the CDC's 2017 report, 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months were vaccinated against MMR, 92.7% against polio. Vaccination acceptance is way more universal than the internet's portrayal of vaccination rates
0/0	According to the NIH, brain fog, headaches, blood pressure swings are potential long term side effects of the Covid vaccine. Their claim is this is rare but the numbers aren’t easy to find. So what they mean by “rare” isn’t clear.
1/1	According to the WHO, "there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection."
1/-1	According to the data, you will have a minor-moderate side effects of covid
0/0	According to your own data the covid 19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine to date
0/0	According to your theory all the unvaccinated staff will die of covid anyway and the vaccine IS killing people not to mention heart issues strokes clots. Imagine being vaccinated can STILL be really ill/die of covid AND have the risk of adverse effects!
1/1	Ace, thats 2 vaccines with over 90% success that dont have a rare clotting side effect
1/1	Achievement unlocked. Shot number two in the books. Thank you science!
1/1	Achieving immunity can only be accomplished through widespread vaccination.
1/1	Achieving immunity is possible through COVID-19 vaccination.
0/0	Active immunity AKA natural immunity is way safer than vaccines because there are no potential side effects having the sickness but then you conquer it and you never get again
1/1	Actor Sonakshi Sinha's message is loud and clear: Vaccine is our biggest weapon in this ongoing battle against the #COVID19 pandemic. Sonakshi joins us in our mission to encourage all adults and adolescents (15-18) to get the #SurakshaKaTika against the virus. Watch, share and get vaccinated today! Register on cowin.gov.in
0/0	Actors??, I like this theory, I always thought they don't look like real doctors
1/0	Actually I might be getting the Covid-19 vaccine because of my job, even though I have reservation about it. We now have mandatory Covid test in place at work, sometimes every week or fortnightly. Because we are food manufacturing facility, it's recommended for us employees to have the vaccine starting March 1, 2021. We only need to show our latest payslip in any vaccination centers showing the employer's name.
1/1	Actually a lot of the people in my country had the sputnik vaccine and it works pretty well! Even my mom who is a doctor told me its not bad
0/0	Actually here in London 75percent of NHS doctors and nurses have refused the vaccine so please educate yourself beyond one video lol
0/0	Actually here’s the truth… @pfizer over there spreading #misinformation and maybe their CEO should be held criminally liable for those lies they keep spreading… #VaxxInjuries #VAERS #VAXXkills #VAXXdeaths
1/1	Actually it’s effective, just some delusional people that think vaccine prevents you from getting the virus or having a small chance to even die from it when you have prior health problems.
1/1	Actually my friend had no adverse effects after the injection
0/0	Actually recent studies have proven the those who did not get vaccinated have had the best outcome it’s the vaccinated who are still getting sick and are the greater majority of people presently Hospitalized!
1/1	Actually the opposite. Vaccine is safe but even mild cases of COVID can leave people with Long Covid which can be debilitating for many .
0/0	Actually the risk is the other way around. The vaccine is higher risk. There are safe, effective treatments that have nothing to do with vaccination.
0/0	Actually this vaccine is the best way to get Covid not prevent it.
1/1	Actually we need an effective vaccine as of yesterday but it isn’t likely to become fully available until sometime next year. We need it to protect against the coronavirus infection. A good vaccine will do that (we hope). Those who ignored basic protections and helped spread the disease probably represent the most important need for the medicine.
0/1	Actually, 0% of Americans or anyone else have gotten the vaccine. Instead, they got a covid shot. Vaccine is supposed to prevent infection
0/0	Actually, COVID-19 caused less mortality than the flu up until around the 15-24 age range last year. Measles has been identified to have an IFR of around .5% in children, whereas COVID is estimated around 0.003% for 0-19.
0/0	Actually, more people have died after the vaccine rollout than the year before without the vaccine & the more deadly variant. Also, more people have been hospitalized with the Omicron variant 2 years after the vaccine rollout than the original more deadly variant with no vaccine
0/0	Actually, mrna has NEVER been used on humans, a quick Google search will show you that. And yes, I know its been used in trials BUT never actually used on humans.
0/0	Actually, no one in the world should take it.
0/0	Actually, not being sick means your immune system is working. There is nothing normal about injecting this crap into your body for a supposed “virus” that has a 99.7% recovery rate. FFS How does anyone believe this nonsense?
1/1	Actually, the vaccine does help stop you from becoming seriously ill with the virus, and substantially reduces your likelihood of infecting others.
1/1	Actually, we NEED #Vaccine .
0/0	Add another measure to the chart... deaths from corona vaccine...anyone who dies 28 days of having a vaccine..
0/0	Add most of the blue state governors. There should've NEVER been an emergency
1/1	Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 — making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity
1/-1	Additional €6,15 billion raised for vaccines, tests & treatment.
1/1	Additionally mRNA vaccines have been USED in cancer therapy successfully.
0/0	Additionally, the COVID vaccinations could also be involved. Many people are receiving stage 4 cancer diagnoses right away!
1/-1	Adler....how wise you are ❗❗❗❗ But be very careful in protecting yourself ❗❗
1/1	Admittedly my plan was to wait on a vaccine so I could get the good one rather than the first one however with the 1st seemly to have a 90% effectiness perhaps the 1st is the correct choice. I have two risk factors and my county has a 15% positivity rate so might be of the essence.
0/-1	Adults are just acting like cry babies about having to be vaccinated to participate in certain activities.

1/1	After doubts were raised about the safety of the Oxford vaccine ( what we call Covishield) the UK immediately imported 1.7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and is already injecting people. That’s the kind of pro active approach our Covid czars need to follow
1/-1	After getting my first COVID vaccine, I can confirm it gives you 5G. My phone bars have increased exponentially and I've even activated augmented hearing. Well worth the effort it took to finding a vaccine.

1/1	After my first AstraZeneca vaccine jab, I went back to work immediately after, and not until dinner time the very evening, started feeling extremely lethargic, tired and weak all over. At one point when sitting down, it’s so difficult to even get back up - the ‘sensation’ was peculiar, like being half drunk, yet with a perfectly clear mind at the same time. However the first night’s sleep was nevertheless fantastic, had gone straight into dreams and I was feeling refreshed the next morning.
1/-1	After my first dose (see previous post for details), I thought maybe I got the side-effects “out of the way”.

1/-1	After the shots, you might experience a sore arm, a mild fever or body aches, but this doesn’t mean you have COVID-19. These symptoms, if they happen at all, are temporary, usually lasting only a day or two.
0/0	After the vaccine I have been more tired and it’s been like 3 months...I’m 15 so there’s not much explanation on why I have to get it. It’s unnecessary
1/1	After the vaccine is injected, your body uses instructions in the DNA/RNA to make copies of this virus part (or antigen). Your body recognises these and mounts an immune response, ready to protect you the next time you encounter the virus.
1/1	After the vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
0/0	After these fast releases of the vaccines I am starting to doubt more things about the health services in general. Am I the only one?

1/1	After this explanation, I'm ready to cancel my vaccine appointment. Just kidding😷
1/1	After time as with all vaccines, the more people vaccinated will lessen the constant spreading and infection of this nasty virus. I wish everyone understood how important vaccines have always been.
1/1	After two years with masks and shutdowns and various restrictions people want their lives back. If you are vaccinated it’s clear your risk of serious illness is very low.
0/0	After vaccination, my muscles are twitchin, heart rate is irregular, sensitive to light.. wtf is happening
1/1	After waiting 2 weeks for the vaccine to kick in, I joined up with some vax’d friends for some long-awaited tabletop throwdown. I didn’t realize how badly I missed in-person gaming, but now I can’t wait until we have Covid under control so we can bring back conventions safely
1/1	After watching this and a few other videos I definitely feel safe taking this vaccine.
1/1	After watching this video I found out that several of my family members who are unvaccinated had gotten covid and since then one has died today actually. One other is fighting with pneumonia on oxygen. It's true this is serious and it's real. I'm praying that people will realize that the vaccine saves lives. 🙏
1/1	After we passed 100 million vaccinations in the EU, I’m very glad I got my first shot of #COVID19 vaccine today. Vaccinations will further gather pace, as deliveries are accelerating in the EU. The swifter we vaccinate, the sooner we can control the pandemic. #StrongerTogether
1/-1	After we're vaccinated, must we still wear a mask to protect those who have not been vaccinated?
0/1	After what we know now and all the people that have been severely damaged by the "vaccine", I have to admit my shock that Dr. Cohen would still say that he thinks the vaccine is still appropriate for some.
0/-1	After what we’ve seen and experienced and learned in the last 18 months I wouldn’t trust any of these people as far as you can throw them
1/1	After you get the first vaccination, your body is reving up the immune system and ready to fight COVID if it comes.
0/0	After you get your 6th & 7th boosters, you'll be ready for your 8th & 9th! Happy holidays!
0/-1	After you get your booster, you're going to need another one. After that one, you'll need another. Eventually, it'll be the side effects that get you, not covid. It's a roll of the dice either way.
0/-1	After your support for compulsory vaccination of children and care workers, you have lost my support.
0	Again more propaganda. When will people learn that this vaccine equals death.
0	Again, I don't know how many times this needs stated, it's not just about the mortality rates, it's the side effects.
1/1	Again, VERY VERY HAPPY I GOT THE VACCINE, LOVE ME SOME VACCINATION, but whoooo boy, last night was ROUGH. That second shot does NOT play, and I'm very glad I'd already put stuff in motion to take today off completely.
0/0	Against and very much alive.
0/0	Against it when it came out, and still against it after getting covid a few weeks ago
1/-1	Age 0-19 death rate is 0.0013%.
1/1	Age adjusted data say vaccinated are 23x less likely to be hospitalized for covid19.
0/0	Age from 0 to 130 should not take a vaccine
0	Agenda 21! Do not trust the government
0/0	Agonizing and tragic to hear of these outcomes. I am impaired, too. And the ONLY reason I got this wretched, DNA-ruining shot (not a vaccine) was because everyone around, brain-washed by “the experts”, told me that I had to get it to stop transmission, which was TOTAL LIE.
1/1	Agree - everyone get vaccinated and get boosted I have. Never thought any of my family would test positive until my niece did. Thinks she picked it up at the supermarket, that`s how easy it can be contracted. She is well now, lesson learned - "take no chances".
0/0	Agree 100% with her there is no covid pandemic they have just renamed the flu i am not having vaccine or testing
1/1	Agree completely. Vaccination is the best way to develop an immunity system. And continue to follow safety protocols
0/0	Agree with you. The testing is suspect...the advertising ridiculous. People should decide for themselves. Ill wait.
1/1	Agree, I felt the same way and now I'm proud to say and relieved that I got my first dose. Trying to be part of the solution and the problem. Not to mention that as a dental hygienist I have a high risk job
0/1	Agreed!...we, (those who are vaccinated), can comfortably enjoy attending the above mentioned venues even more without worrying about passing COVID or getting COVID. Their loss, our gain!
0/0	Agreed. I'm not personally vaccinated because I already had covid, and I'm not personally willing to take the vaccine and have a small chance of side effects. I feel good about my natural immunity but I made sure to encourage my parents and older inlaws to get vaccinated simply to reduce symptoms when they inevitably got covid. (They all did after vaxxed). The idea that the vaccine is a tracking device or whatever else is moronic, but the vaccine that isn't a vaccine fell flat on its face and now it's about control. I'm not anti-vax I'm anti mandate. I don't care what definitions Websters changes.
0/0	Agreed. I’m not going to be pro-Covid vaccine because Trump says. I’ve never cared what Trump did or didn’t do as long as he left me the fuck alone, just as I wish Biden would. I’m also not scared and don’t wear a mask, etc. I had Covid.
1/0	Agreed. Too bad we got putin's puppy as president, which i'm sure he will try to make money off the vaccine for himself.
1/1	Ah well, Let those of us who want it, get it and let us empathise with the families of the rest as we read about their funerals .
0/0	Ah yeah.. JnJ, the company giving u cancer with the baby powder...lol.. y'all hurry up and get those vaccines!
1/1	Ah yes I CAN NOT WAIT for anti vaxxers to reject the vaccine and then all die, at least it would take out the retards who believe in everything thing they hear from one guy or one side.
0/0	Ah yes, no vaccine has been successfully created for the common cold, SARS, or any other coronavirus; but I'm sure this rushed vaccine made in 8 months is perfectly safe AND effective despite a minimal testing period or available studies on long term side affects.
1/0	Ah yes, the Karen’s have come together to make the ultimate cringe
0/1	Ah yes. These televised vaccines has really convinced me to inject it into my own body. Thank you for posting!
1/1	Ahh inject it into my veins as quickly as possible! It is a well known fact that most anti vaxxers are actually just scared of needles😂they’re babies
0/0	Ahhh never!
1/1	Ahhh yes, the classic “Obama divided the country.” Haven’t heard that one in a while. The gall of a qualified black man running for President in the 21st century, eh? Look Ivar McTin, it’s not his fault that you’re a redneck racist motherfucker who fell down the Fox News rabbit hole ass first.Have fun on the ventilator, pal. Thoughts and prayers asshole
0/0	Ain't nothing good about the vaccine!!!!!!! Just the fact that they're trying to force it on you and they tell you at first you going to wait 75 years for the results that should tell you right there don't get nowhere near it!!!!!!!

0/-1	Aka serious, life threatening vx injury.
1/1	Akways love listening but have to say the COVID section failed on some basic facts. The biggest piece of missing context is that the vaccines unequivocally worked and still work to reduce the risk of serious illness and death. Their rapid implementation saved a huge number of lives, ended the overloaded hospitals. etc. Multiple papers support the idea that even if the protection against transmission fades pretty quickly, the immune memory that prevents serious illness is more durable. It's hard to judge the marginal value of a 3rd., 4th or Xth shot in this regard, but there's no question you're safer having the initial vaccinations (at least as an adult). Also, if we're talking about myocarditis, it's important to note that the risk of myocarditis from actually having COVID is a good ways higher than from getting the shot. (one example, study of 43 million people: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059970) ) Not that this should shut down debate, it gets complicated - does that benefit still hold when infection is near-universal anyway? what if those illnesses are milder due to the vax? etc. -- but you can't just say, "the vaccination raises risk of myocarditis, ergo it's dangerous" Even allowing that this myocarditis is almost always mild. Anyway, your push for transparency and ongoing questioning of the science is a good thing but the audience lost out in the spin here.

1/1	Alhamdlillahi. I have got my 1st dose of covid 19 vaccine. And i am doing well.
0/0	All 3 vaccines are dangerous. The only safe vaccine is not yet available. I am not taking any of these vaccines. I'm willing to wait few more years for the safest vaccine. Its better dying from a virus then to take an unsafe newly invented vaccine that i don't trust. Thanks

1/1	All Cdns need to read this. The group is mostly made up of otherwise healthy athletes, mostly under the age of 30. This #BrazilVariant needs to be taken seriously. We need to distance, mask, vaccinate & reject #antivax #antimask activism.
0/0	All I am going to say is my grandma and my grand-grandma as well as my grandpa all died well OVER 90 and in peace, solely by trusting God and not seeing doctors for most of their life.
1/-1	All I ask is that you don't listen to “the internet." Ask your doctor, the one who's been taking care of you for years. Ask them any question you want to about it, even if you think it sounds stupid. My wife has been fielding questions for months now, she's happy to answer.
1/1	All I can say is give me the shot. I could care less. Herd immunity helps decrease the number of variants on this virus. The more the merrier is so TRUE.
1/1	All I can say is take the vaccine!!
1/1	All I can say is thank God I am #vaccinated and boosted. Finally got COVID, but fairly mild symptoms, sore throat, headache and a cough. Being a smoker for 50 years I know it's the vaccine that has kept my symptoms at bay. So say what you want, but my advice is to get vaccinated!
1/0	All I can say is that natural selection should take it course 🙂
0/0	All I can say with 100% confidence is that I won't be the only one who dies when they come trying to force it at my house
1/1	All I can say, is being older and full of underlying conditions, I was glad to be vaxxed and boosted when some selfish person got in my face and gave me Covid last Dec. Though asymtomatic, saddled me with after-effects for 3 months, BUT kept me out of the hospital. Thank you researchers, and people who still live by science, not wishful thinking.
1/1	All I can tell you is I got Covid twice in ‘22. Never had a booster. Experienced brain fog and fatigue and other weird shit like rashes. Got the bivalent booster a couple months after second infection and in 5-7 days all that long covid shit started to disappear.
0/1	All I gotta say is the next time all us weirdo, tinfoil hat wearing potheads are screaming from the rooftops, remember the past 3 years. Having a deep seated distrust for those in power has served me well in my 40 years.
0/0	All I had to do was recall the information I already had concerning OxyContin. The choice was easy.
1/1	All I have to say I hope we can keep pumping these vaccines out. The world needs to get flooded with vaccines to get things back to normalcy.
1/1	All I have to say is Your life your choice Get vaccinated that simple!!
0/0	All I heard was lie after lie.... There is no covid19
1/1	All I know is I did all the vaccines but when I got COVID I was SO sick but it was like a really bad cold. And everyone I ran into (much younger than me) told me COVID horror stories, like "I had a fever for 12 weeks." "Or I still can't walk my more than 5 minutes without sitting down and it's been three months." These are all people without the vaccine. I got sick for a week and recovered fully. I'm older and have high risk factors. I know I would have died without the vaccine.

0/0	All RNA viruses can't be vaccinated against7
1/1	All anarchists should be pro vax. We're not 12 year olds who do the opposite of what our parents say just because. Vaccinations are safe and administered in the majority they protect the weakest, which is a clear case of solidarity. We do it not because it is mandated or encouraged by the government but because we help our fellow humans

1/1	All drugs have side effects, but the benefits far outweight the possible risk.
0/0	All drugs/vaccines go through this process. Initially they are safe, effective wonder drugs. Then after months/years/too often decades drug/vaccine found to be ineffective, dangerous, eventually withdrawn/banned. I have described it as 'The Ages of Drugs'

1/1	All my coworkers reacted to their shot within 24 hours, so when I had no reaction during that time, I thought I was in the clear. But, nope. 36 hours later, I was in bed alternating between chills and feeling like I was burning up. 48 hours post vaccine, all better! Worth it.

0/0	All of my vaxxed and boosted co-workers are going out sick with covid. It’s ridiculous... unvaxxed have to work extra and pick up extra shifts and job duties.
0/0	All of that reasoning is very nice. This is easier. They were performing an experiment with a novel treatment method. Risk of the virus was very, very low. Risk of the treatment is unknown. I'll take my chances. I'm in the Control Group.

0/0	All the vaccines are poison. Not just the "experimental" ones.
1/1	All the vaccines are safe and incredibly protective against severe COVID-19. They will keep you from getting really sick. They will keep you out of the hospital. They will save your life. They will help sustainably end transmission in the population.
1/1	All the vaccines being used have been produced by large and known pharmaceutical companies. It is our duty to be all vaccinated to stop Covid
1/0	All the vaccines that are developed so far, have been tested on people because covid 19 is a much more serious and deadly disease in older people, all the developers had ensured that older people and people with underlying diseases like hypertension, diabetics, and heart are safe and vaccine works efficiently
1/1	All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.

0/0	All those vaccines made you autistic, as expected
1/1	All those who do not want to be vaccinated are ignorant and selfish people who do not care the least about their health and much less about the health of others.
1/1	All three vaccines are holding strong against COVID unlike not being vaccinated
0/0	All to scare people into taking the poison shots... The real vaxxed are now carriers of the real virus that spreads to the un-vaxxed.... Be aware, stay away from the vaxxed.....
0/0	All u have to do is just a little research, a tiny bit of research, and you’ll run so far away from that vaccine !
0/0	All vaccinated is the one who got the virus please explain clearly WHO so people believe you clearly clearly clearly
1/1	All vaccinations should be mandatory. Jab or prison.
1/0	All vaccine science is designed to imitate and trigger natural immunity. The suggestion that natural immunity is inferior to a synthetic/genetic vaccine undermines all trust and faith in public health, and, in science itself.
0/0	All vaccines adverse reactions listed directly on the package insert is : DEATH
1	All vaccines and medications have side effects thats the truth but its still better to take them.
1/1	All vaccines are def not fake, as you sarcastically put it. They have literally saved lives from many diseases.
1/1	All vaccines are good. My point here is that having a choice is already a privilege in itself.
1/1	All vaccines are like that. That’s why we need everyone vaccinated. It’s 95% effective against getting sick at all though. The chicken pox vaccine is 60-100% effectiveness. When was the last time you heard of a kid getting chicken pox? Long time ago I bet.
0/0	All vaccines are poison, GMO, fetal tissue, animal gene. Be smart.
1/0	All vaccines are safe and effective. I got this information from r/pics
1/0	All vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.
1/1	All vaccines are super safe.
1/1	All vaccines carry a risk for some. So the issue becomes which is the greater harm. Having a vaccinated population saves more lives than the harm done by an unvaccinated population
1/1	All vaccines cause an auto immune response.
0/0	All vaccines don’t stop the spread of disease. All are dangerous. All made by the same companies
0/0	All vaccines harm
0/0	All vaccines have risks and should always be voluntary.
0/0	All vaccines in general are dangerous and ineffective. They have injured and killed people in the past.
1/1	All vaccines in the country are safe for use!!!
1/1	All vaccines show to be effective with the omicron in that when infected, your symptoms will be mild.
0/0	All vax is poison.
0/0	All western countries chose to be permanently childless….
1	All you can do is research to the best of your ability. Talk to people who have had the vaccine, find out if they have had suffered side effects, and, if they have, how severe? Find out about COVID-19, how safe would it be if you had this disease? Would you likely survive? Would your grandparents or elderly neighbour survive if they became affected through your giving them the Corona virus? I had the first injection three weeks shot. Apart from a sore arm, I have had no ill effects. I am glad that I have had it, because I am now far less likely to die from Corona virus.
0/0	All you little pro vaxx people need to wake up and see that you're litteraly being brainwashed.
0/0	All you need to know is anything that gets rushed and not studied or tested properly is not safe.,
0/0/0/0/0	All you need to know is you can still get COVID after taking the shot and you’ll die wearing your mask because they’re never going away. So enjoy bells palsy and an assortment of other side effects.
0/0	All you people who say you won't take it need to stick with it. I don't want to be one of the last hold outs when they start blocking people from entering stores without proof of vaccination. Or if my job makes it mandatory. It has to be all of us.
0/0	All you people who think this shot is ok fine get it and good luck. But when young kids and athletes that are in excellent shape drop dead or have heart attacks like the caddy today at the golf tournament that’s just not normal. So for me and all my family it’s a big no…..
0/0	Allah will save me, don’t need no needles
0/0	Allergic reaction. How about just Fucking Poison
0/0	Allergic reaction? Ya mean side affects
0/0	Allergic reactions and face paralysis are some of the side effects so far. You would have to be out of your mind to take the vaccine.
0/0	Allow a maturing immune system to naturally strive. What's wrong with those demons.
0/0	Allow the natural immune system to fight and strive against the disease, instead of vaccine
1/1	Allowing misinformation about a life saving vaccine and causing ppl not to get vaccinated during a pandemic is harmful. Ppl are literally dying because of it. I know 10 ppl personally who have died in the last 2 months because they refused the vaccine
1/1	Almost 4000 people died of Covid just yseterday. Let that number sink in. Most were unvaxxed.
1/1	Almost 76% Americans with one shot now! We are getting so close to being done with this thing.
0/0	Almost all of my younger patients got worse after Covid shot. And I have lost my aprobation for not being "Covid vaxed" we still have this law in France and in Germany
1/1	Almost all vaccines do not prevent 100% transmission or infection. The Covid vaccines are vastly safer than Covid itself.
0/0	Almost all vaccines have bad side effects and aren't worth it
1/1	Almost convinced me that perhaps COVID-19 could be used to get rid of some of the stupid ones! This is a pandemic boys and girls. It can kill a lot of people. The rules are intended to keep,you safe from it.
1/0	Almost every complication shows up within two weeks. So far, the mild side effects are the ones you want
0/0/0	Almost every person that I know that has Covid is vaccinated. And they have had it multiple times.
0/-1	Almost everyone i know has caught covid including myself, a mixture of vaccinated and unvaccinated. Everyone suffered near identical symptoms and recovered after a week
0/0	Almost exactly 9 months after the mRNA vaccinations started, we saw a massive drop in the birthrates in Sweden. Why isn't this bigger news?
1/1	Almost like it’s causing an immune response based on the antibodies your body has been making since the first dose.
0/0	Almost like they want us to just shut up and obey and take this new untested experimental vaccine for some reason they seem desperate that we all take it.
0/0	Almost looks like a conspiracy to make people infertile, like they are more worried about overpopulation than the actual virus.
1/1	Almost no one over the age of 65 is against vaccines, why? Because thees people saw friends and family crippled or die from times before vaccines.
1/1	Almost nobody has suffered a vaccine injury. You do realise that not even over the counter drugs like Aspirin are 100% free of side effects?
1/1	Almost time to help our lovely Canadian pals! Also I got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday and I’m HYPED
1/1	Almost weekly I read a story about 1 or both unvaccinated parents dying and leaving kids behind. Those kids are going to grow up, learn the truth, and say, "Our parents were idiots".
1/-1	Alot of money moved during this pandemic
0/0	Alot of the more serious side effects seem to be getting left out here ?????? Myocarditis, blood clots, death etc. At least be upfront about the risks..then you might gain more trust from people.
1/-1	Already 29 days ago I got COVID 19 vaccine moderna third doze
1	Already been a little over six hours since my first dose, and aside of the ungodly arm pain I’m experiencing right now, I’m feeling fine. #CovidVaccine
1/1	Already contracted the shitty thing during first wave so not in a big rush to get vaccinated. Not afraid of vaccines and will happily do it to help vulnerable people out there but I will wait my turn since I’m in my late 20s. Would love more info about possible adverse reactions (I have few allergies myself) and the likelihood of reinfections (suffered from IRDS as I was a premature child and I’m terrified I used up all my “good odds” with first infection - so I hope it happens only once) but I guess I can only wait for that.
1/1	Already did, and I highly recommend it. There is no risk, and there are no microchips involved
1	Already did. Most vaccines need boosters, this is nothing new.
1/1	Already got dose two. A sore arm and an afternoon nap were a price worth paying. If only someone had actually done something like this six months ago instead of trying to suppress testing and lying about the severity of the issue...
1/1	Already got it. I really dont care about the vaccine, it really is not that deep of a situation as the conspirators say it is. I just dont understand why people are against it so much.
1/1	Already got my first dose.
1/1	Already got my first shot. I can't wait for a normal summer.
1/1	Already got my flu vaccine and I can't wait to get the COVID vaccine
1/1	Already got my fourth Biden vaccine (at no cost). Thanks joe!
1/1	Already got them. Not planning on being a statistic due to ignorance.
0/0	Already had and recovered from covid. I wont be taking any vaccine anytime soon. I'm going to need to see alot more long term effects results
1/1	Already had both and waiting for the booster. Because I'm not a fucking imbecile and don't want me or the people I care about to die horribly.
0/0/0/0/0	Already had covid not taking a vaccine
1/1	Already have. And I feel great.
1/1	Already in some countries people who choose not to be vaccinated have to pay for the time they are on a ventilator in a hospital, that gets their attention
0/-1	Already know 3 people died after the . The reason was : one heart attack and 2 from cobid
1/0	Alrhough I don't understand everything, at least I understand something! Ty, Jesus bless you Medcram
1/1	Alright Mary it's time to go to bed, yall don't want to take a vaccine that has passed multiple human trials, no hospitalizations, no deaths, and still are naive to it. If it makes you feel better Trump was one who started funding and made sure it was safe 😏 So you're so-called "Micro Chip" theory can get put to rest
1/1	Also I hope you fall into one of the tiers approved for vaccination. Please dont jump the line.
1/1	Also I’m getting the second covid vaccine today
0/0	Also even myself, i had my own similar experience where my vaccinated friend got it and I was with him 12 hours before his symptoms showed. Maybe all their immune systems are shot?
0/-1	Also had someone we know die 3 days after the vaccine and he was only 36 healthy
1/1	Also if doctors were al a part of some conspiracy why would they all be getting it?
0/0	Also if you have a strong immune system there is no need for the vaccine
0/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself.
1/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself. You do realize it's still not as bad as the flu right?
1/1	Also mind blowing when ppl say they won't get the vaccine because they don't know the long term effects (which i agree to an extent) , but yet don't give a shit about the long term effects covid has. I rather get the vaccine than get covid.
1/0	Also sets a dangerous precedent for further erosion of safety and readiness.
1/-1	Also sitting here watching some videos on COVID-19 vaccine symptoms and how it all works. It's fascinating, and the human body is just incredible!
0/0	Also the amish never take vaccines and therefore you will never find an autistic amish.
1/1	Also this morning, I've had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	Also, 45?! Did the vax age you like spoiled milk too? Phew! Sue them, girl!
0/0	Also, I researched the vaccines attempts for sars and mers. Yes, there will be some post injection adverse reactions but it was the long term immune system issues that were the problem. Have not found anything yet that says they overcame those issues. So, the long term consequences are not known by the public but pretty sure the vaccine pushers know.
1/1	Also, brain clots aren't contagious, Covid is. I've got my 2nd AV Jab in a couple of weeks, and have exactly zero concerns.
0/0	Also, the vaccine will kill you before then. Good luck on killer Vax!
1/1	Also. If you are eligible, PLEASE get vaccinated!
0/0	Altering instructions with mRNA to respond to a virus is genetic manipulation and changes the DNA blueprint that you are born with.....no thanks, i'll stay me.
1/1	Alternative title: Kurzgesagt politely roasting anti-vaxs in a nutshell.
0/0	Although I am fully vaccinated, I would refuse a third vaccination due to the most severe side effects.
1/1	Although I am not from the UK and will likely not receive any doses for the coming weeks, this is incredibly good news!! I hope other health agencies also finds the vaccine to be safe.
1/1	Although I am still very young, I’m more politically active, which I mean in many ways. My father is a healthcare worker and got the vaccine in December of 2020. He was fine, just the normal sore arm, like you would get after a normal vaccine. After his second dose, he had caught a minor cold, but he got over it pretty quickly. While different people have different reactions, most people that I know that have gotten the vaccine were fine after their first dose, but after the second one, they had gotten a cold or fever. Nothing major. While my mother had just gotten the vaccine and is still waiting for her second dose, she hasn’t had anything severe happen to her. Again, I’m not old enough as the vaccine is 16+, I will be making the executive decision to get the vaccine. While I’m still a child, therefore this decision is not entirely mine, I would’ve gotten it anyway. I know it would decrease the risk of COVID. So the simple answer is, yes. And I would recommend you do the same.
1/1	Although I've already had Covid I still plan on taking a vaccine eventually. I've been nervous about the mRNA vaccine but feel so much reassure by this explanation.
1/1	Although as a Canadian with a right to a choice, ill take any except for the Astrazeneca one.
1/1	Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral.
1/1	Although the vaccine is rushed that doesnt mean it isnt safe for use. they aren't just skipping past the "testing phase", they are still taking many precautions to make sure its effects do more good than harm.
0/0	Although the vaccines appear to be relatively safe, we don’t have long term data on their safety and side effects. Most common vaccines are tested for ten or more years before wide distribution. The human test run is occurring right now in real time.
0	Although they've clearly tried to add in the few individuals with the intention of making them look stupid, they've done the exact opposite. Simply not wanting to do something because you don't want to is perfectly valid. Consent is a think that matters in all aspects of life. People shouldn't have to justify their personal decision for their own body.
0/0	Aluminum......Antifreeze.......Acetone.......Mercury.......Formaldehyde......Fetal Tissue.......It's everything you've ever wanted in a Vaccine or Witches Potion.
1/1	Always get my flu and other vaccines. Will get the covid vaccine as soon as it is available to seniors in Orlando
1/1	Always get the flu shot and I will getting the booster, too. Thank science we have these very important and lifesaving tools at our disposal
0/-1	Always great to see the vast majority of comments are from the ones that never went near the vaccines, or won't take anymore of them. Gives me hope in humanity, and has always confirmed to me that the unvaxxed number are skewed for the agenda. I think they are saying 40 million unvaxxed in the US now. Amazing it was apparently 100 million only 2 months ago and they are pretending 60 million ran out and got injected since then.
1/1	Always prevention is better than treatment period.
0/0	Always staying safe...too afraid to have it
1/-1	Always take care dear
1/-1	Always trusted vaccines, but I never knew how different the newer ones are from past vaccines.
1/1	Always vaccinate!
0/-1	Am A Little Bit Confused?!?
1/1	Am I supposed to feel bad? He got what he wanted. The "freedom" to not take the Jab. I guess someone should've told him "freedom isnt free".
0/0	Am I the only one concerned about the possible long term carcinogenic effects of an mRNA vaccine?
1/1	Am Pfizer fully vaccinated.. Tnx biontech :)
0/0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die

0/0	Am not taking vaccine neither any of my kids taking that shit that's my law
1/1	Am seeing cases now of vaccinated patients not catching covid at all when exposed at home - or much milder illness, Dramatic local outbreak in local care home where those vaccinated were spared.This is 1st hand / coal face experience
0/0	Am sure they are safe as possible, but I don’t like the idea of it all
0/0	Am very sceptical about this deadly vaccine.
1/1	Amazing explanation of these vaccines and how they work. Thank you so much for this video, you're an excellent teacher!
1	Amazing how being around more vaccinated people made kids less likely to get infected. Seems like basic common sense to me but here we are.
1/1	Amazing how people can deny the one constant in the entire universe... Science.
0/0	Amazing how people like this woman are still believing the medical establishment after everything they’ve been through
1/1	Amazing how the anti-vaxxers were so quick to jump on what appears to be a whole lot of nothing - but then they ignore all the positives provided by the vaccine.
1/1	Amazing how the anti-vaxxers were so quick to jump on what appears to be a whole lot of nothing - but then they ignore all the positives provided by the vaccine. Classic case of cognitive bias.
1/1	Amazing information in such dark times!! Got mine two weeks ago no side effects
1/1	Amazing job Pfizer and BioNTech! Hope they start implementing vaccine passports to keep the people who are afraid of the shot at home.
1/1	Amazing news, get every one injected ASAP, let's get on top of this virus and get back to some kind of normality.
1/1	Amazing that people can work in a medical environment and be opposed to vaccines. How did these idiots ever get through school or get employed in the first place?
1/0/1	Amazing that we're getting to the point of dictating instructions to the cells
1/1	Amazing they have a vaccine already !
1/1	Amazing to think there are still millions of adult Americans who have yet to get a single Covid shot. I assume most of them are MAGA types who are counting on herd immunity, or else they are misanthropes and hermits who live alone in the backcountry.
0/1	Amazing vaccine
1/-1	Amazing video bro, taught me so much and presented in a nice logical order with visuals. This is what they need to keep replaying on mainstream media for the rest of the idiiots.
1/1/1/-1	Amazing video! I'm glad I caught up to this before taking my first shot of Pfizer's. Most of my family are vaccinated with the two doses and barely had side effects. While I may seem as anti-vaccine, I just say that because I don't feel the need to vaccinate myself, but I also don't deny the statistics of a vaccine when it works; lowering death toll and infection rate.
1/1/1/1	Amazing what humans can do when we come together and throw a bunch of money at a common goal. This is why science funding is necessary.
1/1	Amazing! Can't wait to get the lil ones vaccinated!
1/-1	Amazing! Thank you for doing this!
0/0	Amazing, isn’t it? In order to avoid an illness with few or mild symptoms, you get a severe reaction, instead, to a vaccine which doesn’t actually protect you from the illness with few or mild symptoms that you’re trying to avoid.
0/0	Amazing. Most drugs and vaccines take years to get FDA approval. Now the covid vaccine is approved in months. Something stinks like rotten chicken.
1/1	Amen Preach Bishop Covid 19 is being spread through the unvaccinated. Why people can’t see that? They are letting Satan blind them from truth.
0/0	Amen!! I really wish vaccinated would not get so angry. We all realize they were lied to nobody is insult them them. People really need to realize, just because they OK….Does NOT mean everyone is …that is the way anaphylaxis/bad reactions work.
0/0	Amen, sister!!! I'm not getting the shot, I'm healthy & feeling fine!! Tomorrow's my 73rd birthday 😊😊
1/1	Amen. The risks of not getting vaccinated outweigh the risks of COVID. Period.
1/1	America has done an incredible job with the vaccines after that hiccup at the beginning
1/-1	America is great because the willfully ignorant can lawfully assemble to demonstrate that they have the freedom to be a grave hazard to public health.
1/1	America is one of the greatest coutries in the world, but is sadly one of the most misinformed - or mislead. The vaccine saves lives, but conspiracy theorist sprout danger in every corner.
0/0	America is under attack by China, that's why we are forced to take the vaccine.
0/-1/-1	America wouldn’t need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic
1/1/0/1/0/-1/-1	America wouldn’t need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic...
1/1/1/1	American here. Just received my J&J vaccine a few hours ago. So far, so good!
1/1	American parents will let their children die of Covid rather than getting them a vaccine,their childs need these!!!
1/1	Americans aged 50 to 64 who are unvaccinated are 46 times more likely to end up in the hospital with Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted.
1/1	Americans are dying of COVID at the rate of over 1,100 a day, and 98% of them are unvaxxed. This is the finding of the states of Texas, Georgia and Arizona, among others.
1/1	Americans are taught to doubt others. Unfortunately they are not taught to doubt themselves. In fact they consider it a virtue to never be doubtful of their own conviction no matter how unsubstantiated that may be.
1/1	Americans don't know how fortunate they are to actually have the COVID vaccine so available right now. For most Latin American countries, we don't have a choice to make, it is simply not available. I'd love to get my mom and dad vaccinated so I can stop feeling so scared and anxious every single day. It baffles me that you guys are so privileged and don't even realize it sometimes.
0/0	Americans don't trust the msm for regular information. How can we trust them with our lives??
0/0	Americans have been brainwashed to take the deadly vaccines.
1/1	Americans have been eating themselves to death for decades but they don't seem to worry about that.
0/1	Americans have some serious trust issues! Doubting the medical field and the doctors. They think they know better than any expert.
1	Americans need to believe in science and actually comprehend it.
0/0	Americans should also have the freedom to decline the vaccine
1/0	Americans: Show us the government officials taking the vaccine and we will see if they mutate into zombies or not. Americans when government officials take the vaccine on live national television: Look at how they blocked the view, its obviously water!
1/-1	Americas Frontline Doctors is the only place you should get your news regarding this nonsense
0/-1	Among all participants, 15% had measurable antibody responses after both dose 1 and dose 2. An antibody response was detectable in 39% of participants after dose 2 but not dose 1, and 46% of participants had no response after dose 1 or dose 2.

0/0	An NHS nurse who has contracted Covid-19 three weeks after being vaccinated says she is "angry and heartbroken"
1/1	An anti vaxer getting autism would be an improvement.
1/1	An anti vaxer is a person who constantly spreads bs about vaccines
1/1	An anti-masker type is the last person I expect to be telling the truth. Selfish people tell self-serving ‘truths.‘
1/0	An antivax paediatrician? Sounds like an anti-firewall network admin.
1/1	An antivaxxer is like someone not calling the fire department when their house is burning down because they are worried about water damage.
0/0	An autoimmune reaction to the vaccine, and you wonder why more and more people are sick with autoimmune diseases.
1/1	An effective nasal vaccine for Covid would be exceptionally valuable.
1/1	An effective vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you're sick.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine... never before tested on humans.... for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it...and they are lining up for it 🤣💉
1/1	An important piece of advice for high-risk folks. New #AMA report says some of us will get #Covid repeatedly, despite being #vaccinated + #boosted add prior infection. (I evidently am among them.) All preventative measures are advised. https://t.co/SsDATInYkA
0/0	An inhumane practice being done worldwide.
0	An investigation is needed because the information is now hitting the main stream, that's it.
0/0	An risk of blood clotting isn't safe. There have been so many reports of adverse reactions.
1/1	An unsurprising headline: "State trooper who told governor to "kiss my ass" over vaccine order dies of COVID." He leaves behind his wife and four kids. But you know, the far right loved him, so I'm sure it was worth it.
0/0	An untested shot that wont keep you from getting the virus or keep you from spreading it?... so what is it?
1/1	An unvaccinated medical professional is like having a preacher who hasn't been baptized. Wake up people!
1/1	An unvaccinated person is 68 times more likely than a vaccinated person to die and an unvaccinated person Is 16 times more likely to be hospitalised than a vaccinated person. I think that’s telling us that the vaccine stops even more deaths than it stops hospitalisations in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people.
0/0	And HUGELY increase risk of death or serious injection injury
1/-1	And I am NOT the only one reporting these side effects! It’s an immune response.
1/1	And I am so grateful. My parents are both alive because of testing and vaccines.
0/0	And I am still not taking it

1/1	And I for one, applaud their success. It wasn't easy with all of the misinformation and myths about vaccines coming from the right-wing.
1/1	And I had my concerns but after watching this video I feel safe to go for it.
1/1	And I have been crying of happiness because my grandma who is 82 years old just got the first shot! She has been keeping herself safe and now she is waiting for the second shot. She says that she knows that it’s not an indestructible shield but still it will keep her safer and also others around her. She has lovely masks that match with her clothes and she says that she will keep wearing them until the pandemic is over. My grandma is a wonderful role model to follow :)
1/-1	And I live in that country called US. They picked Pfizer and gave that to me. I really want the vaccines made in China, Iran, Cuba or Russia.
0/0	And I still ain't avin the vaccine
0/0	And I thought the experts said the rushed to market vaccine was safe. This story is being covered by all news agencies before some keyboard warrior accuses me of being biased and not carrying out any further research.
1/1	And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine. I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh.
0/1	And I’d say it’s harmful to not at least entertain the idea that it’s completely possible these vaccines are messing with peoples hearts and to not at least admit it’s possible is very dangerous
0/0	And I’ll still pass on the pop control shots
1/0	And I’m still for the life of me am trying to figure out why , if you’re protected (vaccinated), why would you have a problem with me risking my own self health??

1/1	And also allowing the virus a better environment to mutate and make the vaccine less effective in the long run, ensuring that covid will be around for a long time instead of eliminating it when we had the chance.
1/1	And as a scientist, I trust that vaccines do more good than harm.
1/0	And before some idiot comes along and says "well maybe they get different vaccines-" That would mean every healthcare worker handling them would also need to be complicit in the conspiracy.
0/0	And can you say how many people has this vaccinacion has killed...and it has...no thank you i will not be injected…
1/1	And enough. Am getting the jab now.
0/1	And even merrier, China wouldn't be slow at mass manufacturing it for the world. Great news!
1/1	And every single day, the number of Americans who will die will increase unless you #WearAMask and #Vaccinate
0/-1	And from the beginning, anti-vaccination activists were committed to the ideas that COVID-19 vaccines would not work, would be dangerous, and would be promoted by a nefarious global conspiracy.
0/0	And getting that vaccine after living that long was the stupidest thing she could have ever done!
0/0	And hardly a word on taking care of yourself through a healthy lifestyle and not compromising your immune system. Its easier to believe that taking a vaccine that has never been used on humans and produced in the shortest time ever. So many questions answered with trust us. A vaccine that experts cannot tell us the duration of effectiveness, whether or not it will prevent you from transmitting, whether or not it will protect you from the mutations and of course long term adverse effects. I am not criticizing those that take it and will not tolerate criticism for not taking it.
0/0	And here goes down their fertility rate
1/1	And here is to hoping that they have enough common sense to get the vaccine regardless
1/1	And here we are at the end of the year with a vaccine that just got shipped to my state. Fantastic job!
0/0/0	And here we go! The VACCINATED are more likely to get the SA virus!
1/0	And how haven't we managed to get a 90 odd percent positive result with things like malaria etc? Is it because they don't affect us western whites as much? Seems weird that they have managed to create a vaccine that is so affective in such a short space of time to me??
1/1	And how many masked up people got sick and/or died from rona? Millions!!!! We are screwed either way but I am taking my chances with vax. I drive car, take hormone therapy, and work at high risk job. Life is full of risks. Won’t even go into my sucky ass genetica!
0/0	And if it's mandated? I still won't do the jab. I'll gladly go to prison for non compliance.
0/0	And if you have any allergies that you don’t know about don’t come !!!!!!
1/1	And it is not true that vaccines give your children autism and I would personally have a child with autism then a dead kid
0/0	And it isn't just these v4ccines! Those long-term health issues are caused by most vaccines in some people. People with the wrong genetics, I suppose. I'm actually all for depopulation by sterilization. The poor and stupid human is a serious issue and there are too many of us. However, these long-term health issues are what I have a problem with. Another thing is that they're passed on through our descendants. NOT GOOD FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION.
0/0	And it'll work about as good as the covid vaccine (not at all)
0/0	And it's up to people whether they want the jab or not. We all have freedom of choice!
0/0	And it’s finally happened. Broken heart Someone I’ve worked with for almost 10 years passed away two nights ago , one week after his 1st Syringe.
0/0	And just like that the vax doesnt work.
1/1	And kids in this group have died from it also. I know I’d like to prevent that. We give vaccines for sickness that are less deadly, why is there some aversion to this? Do you prefer people keep avoidably dying? Because there’s a lot of people still dying every day from this.
0/0	And mannequins wearing them but what’s dangerous is the vaccine
0/0	And millions still don't, because people are waking up on this deadly vaccine.
1/1	And my heart goes out, to everyone who isn't feeling very sorry. I hope you all live a long and vaccinated life.
0/0	And my natural element immunity is 13 times better than the vaccine so I'll pass.
0/0	And nobody should force me or anyone to take it
0/0	And not to mention all the big companies rolling out these untested vaccines like Pfizer have been sued to death and paid up huge fines for illegal marketing, improper labeling of medications, foreign corrupt practices, bribery, government contract related offenses and drug/medical equipment safety violations. But you can trust them.
0/0	And now bill gates wants to track us with microchips, amazing
1/1	And now there are three! This news just keeps getting better and better!
0/0	And now we are seeing the effects of the poison on people who got it.
0/0	And now we find out that Pfizer removed those who did get sick from the trials! Or they called someone who had to be put on a feeding tube as “gastric upset”! WHAT! The young girl is in a wheel chair and has a feeding tube for the rest of her life! The trials were manipulated !
0/0	And now who is lining up to play guinea pigs
1/1	And of course the drooling, one toothed goobers will still refuse the vaccine. Love how those rabid righties always call themselves "patriots" or "Freedom Fighters." In reality everything is all about them, no social responsibility.
0/0	And once again the Conspiracy Theorist are right. The Vaccine is not Safe and Effective. The Vaccine is Dangerous and Ineffective. What else are they hiding? It’s funny how secrets get spilled when you have a few drinks, trying to get laid.
1/-1	And others out there would rather listen to social media and they’re own personal beliefs which will doom them and others around them
1/-1	And people complain about us Americans being uneducated, stubborn halfwits. The absolute gaul

1/-1	And people still believe the virus is fake...smh
0/0	And please do tell me how the vaccine works... because it sure as hell isn’t working what so ever. Prevents severe disease?
1/1	And sadly it's those medical professionals who give the anti-vaxxers validation for their ignorant beliefs. It's one thing to only have facebook keto mommies touting anti-vaxx nonsense, but when someone who had medical training says it, those who already think that way have a "medical professional" backing it up.
1/1	And shout out to all the anti-vaxx: ‘Believe what you want but please don’t force others into your way of life. There has already been enough pain this year. We don’t want another year of misery because people refuse to take vaccines.’
1/0	And so I expect that by this autumn we'll have lots of 'trial by fire' situations with vaccines in the world.
1/1	And stay home. And get the vaccine.
1/1	And still there are some people who think vaccines will get you sick. Smh
1/1	And suddenly the anti-Vaxxers become YouTube educated experts again
0/0	And that is why people have been calling it a clot shot for years now, yet no one would listen.
1/1	And that is wonderful for you, however, the well over half a million who are DEAD can't tell you that is wasn't that bad! And why would the person who was the so called president tell millions not to get the vaccine, however, he made sure that his family was totally vaccinated.
1/1	And that vaccines aren't necessary because covid is fake but also somehow a Chinese bioterror weapon.
0/0	And that’s exactly why I would NEVER wear a mask or vaccinate! I win
0/0	And that’s how the beginning of I am legend started
0/0	And the COVID vaccines, may well play a part too! Many are being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer right from the start!
0/0	And the animals in the mrna trials were "fine" right after, yet when exposed to illness their body had an auto immune reaction that killed them.
1/1	And the anti vaccine crowd still promote their nonsense. Should be rounded up and forcibly vaccinated
1/0	And the fear propaganda gets more deceptive and brazen. We still refuse to comply.
0/-1	And the liberal is wrong again. No what he calls "anti-vaxxers" which should be far better labeled as "anti mRNA" are now dying far fewer than those who got one or more doses.
0/0	And the masses will receive this via mandated covid-19 vaccine.. good luck mandating me to take that...
1	And the overwhelming majority of Covid deaths have been to the unvaccinated. Real winners.
0/-1	And the propaganda continues. Their day is coming when they will reap what they sow and it won't be pretty.
0/0	And the r / Canada thread is proclaiming how great the vaccine is working. fuckin lol
1	And the vaccine is the only thing today that can stop the pandemic
0/0	And the vax works! Spreads from one vaxed person to the next! Thus, needing another booster, in order to get it again and need another booster...
0	And the way those who refused to take the snake bites were treated by ex-friends and family alike was despicable. You should be ashamed of yourselves. You need to apologize yesterday!
1/1	And their messiah, Trump, still got his vaccine. But of course he did it in private because he couldn't bear to lose his antivax base.
0/0	And then let's talk about the high incidence of vaccine injury
0/0	And then let's talk about the high incidence of vaccine injury.....
1/0	And then the deaths turned from cities to overwhelmingly rural and Republican voters once the initial stages were over and especially once the vaccine was created.
0/0	And then they will tell us that this vaccination campaign is not a scandal! Is it true that Pfizer has a disclaimer in case of side effects after vaccination? - Libération
0/0	And then when it happens to you all you're gonna get is a "Welp I guess you're unlucky"
0/0	And there are broader behavioural science tactics that the government can use to improve the uptake of vaccines, including making it seem like the default and showing it to be a social norm.
0/0	And there was no evidence that the vax prevented infection or transmission, all based on lies.
0/-1	And there’s a connection between eggs and COVID-19. It turns out: egg yolk antibodies neutralize the virus.
0/0	And these are NOT EVEN the LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS !!!!!
0/0	And they call us crazy for passing on this experimental drug!
0/0	And they can shove that Vaccine into the pile of the rest I won't get
0/-1	And they honestly expect people who aren't even worried about Covid to get a vaccine like that???
0/0	And they say it were not lab created.....hm....I think it was! They are actually telling you how they created it without you understanding that they did create the virus!
0/0	And they want to still push this on us, this vaccine
0/0	And this is why I NEVER take the needle...and this is what the corrupt mainstream reports; can't imagine what they're not going to report.
0/0	And this vaccine alters your DNA and immune system and every child you ever make, if you will even be able to have kids after this. In the very small safety trials, 70% became infertile, and vaccinated males caused unvaccinated females to become infertile through their vaccine-altered sperm. By the way, the Pfizer vaccine has AIDS proteins in it and caused at least 60 people in Australia to become HIV positive, which they called “false positives.” If someone injects you with part of the DNA protein strands of AIDS and you wind up HIV positive, then you’re HIV positive.
0/0	And this was back in April! I won’t take the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0	And those that die months or years after taking the vaccine will never be linked to the vaccine
1/1	And to be clear - I am talking about getting vaccinated. It’s the number one thing you can do to keep yourself safe.
0/0	And today the cdc posted this study:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#T2_down of hundreds of patients from New york and California which demonstrates that starting in June 2021 natural immunity provided greater protection than vaccines. Look at the science, folks, if you have the balls. Or stick to your prejudices and read the WA post: the post doesn’t report on the latest CDC research. Any half-assed reporter could go to a protest, interview a hundred people, and present the stupidest people from that large group as examplars of a perspective they are already prejudiced against to foment more prejudice and hatred. And you can read it and hate and call names and think about how smart you are and how stupid everyone you disagree with is, and ignore the science the cdc has just published.
0/0	And vaccine injuries!!!!
0/0	And vaccines affect female fertility. Goes hand in hand.

1/1	And we did nearly 600000 on Sunday probably more than the whole of the EU
1/1	And we have selfish people here in the US that refuse to be vaccinated.
0/0	And what about the countless severe adverse effects that thousands of people, including me, are suffering from since they got their shot(s)? One shot of this experimental "vaccine" changed my life to a nightmare. Just as well as so many other's.
0/0	And what are you going to do about the deaths its causing; i.e. Dr. in Florida died after getting the vaccine or the face paralysis or the other side effects that is happening?
1/1	And what do we do with this information now? Even if an infection protects better than a vaccination, I still prefer the vaccination. Anything else would mean that I would voluntarily become infected, and that would seem pretty stupid to me.
0/0	And what if you didn't inject yourself with crap, and left your immune system alone
0/0	And what is stopping your immune system attacking itself when it realizes there is a foreign entity in its cells?.

1/-1	And when you ask them to cite their sources, it’s always the same response: “Google exists, do your rESeArcH.”
0	And who’s going to be held accountable for this? NO ONE!
1/0	And within these populations they will pass Covid back and forth and takes us to ever more mutated viruses. The government will have to take serious steps both coercive and rewarding in the name of public health to encourage vaccination.
1/1	And yes, I get the flu shot every year.
0/0	And yes, I'm an anti-vaxxer. I won't get that damn vaccine.
1/0	And yet it's not a real vaccine cause it does not prevent them from contracting or spreading covid? Wake up America,
1/1	And yet my friend has been in the hospital for the last month because he did not get the vaccine. His wife did not believe in vaccines.

0/0	And yet people are dying who have taken the vaccines
0/0	And yet, people with both shots and the booster are still getting it.
0/0	And you believe 6 million people died from covid, and still think the vaccine is effective.
0/0	And you believed that the covid-19 vaccine would protect you and your family against covid-19. What a joke that turned out to be but well the best business in town turns out to be a cardiologist now, they are so booked out thanks to the covid-19 vaccine.
0/0	And you didn't even mention potential long term damage to human cells get lost with your experiment
1/1	And you still take meds precribe by your Dr without reasearch of ingredients ?? Now you want to research medicine but for years you just took every pill the Dr precribe without hesitation
0/0	And you won't see this article on any other news site, that's for sure. I'm sure there is already in place a media black out reporting severe side effects or death from the vaccine. The problem is, you don't how it will effect you till it's too late. I'll take my chances with the virus.
1/-1	And, I have the right not to get infected by an idiot not taking precautions against Covid. Also, women have their rights against religious extremists who want to take away their rights. My body, my right.

0/0	Another article claiming the vaccine works and it doesn’t. It will not prevent your from getting it or transmitting it. It may help lessen the affects but that is a prophylactic not a vaccine. Words matter.
0/0	Another big lie about the covid vaccine. IT NEVER STOPPED the spread of covid nor someone from getting covid. He turned our country into a police state and force Americans out of their jobs. YES, @JoeBiden did that!!!

0/0	Another lie from the WHO supposedly there to protect people? #EnoughIsEnough #covidnonsense to make people use chemical alternatives and prevent healthy people! We know better!
1/1	Another massively important finding is that in this huge trial, not a single person was hospitalized with Covid >22 days after single dose vaccination. Not one. That changes everything. Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
0/0	Another mutation,another varriant,same vaccine
1/1	Another non-headline to grab attention .. a 'small study' ... why can't the media wait until the real people .. the scientists and the doctors ... have carried out extensive research to find out the exact facts. That of course wouldn't make a 'worrying, headline.
0/1	Another person died yesterday after the second dose...... #NoVaccineForMe
0/0	Another person dies after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccine4me
1/-1	Another pointless study showing what teenagers can work out, the vaccine helps with hospitalisations but vaccines are not made to reduce hospitalisations they are made to reduce infections which inevitably reduces hospitalisations and deaths it’s really common sense

1/-1	Another reason for the vaccine is not to spread the virus.
1/1	Another reason to be mad at antivaxxers is because they can spread disease. Some people don’t have health insurance or could afford certain vaccines, meanwhile these people who do have health insurance and are privileged enough to afford it choose not to.
1/1	Another stupid anti-vaccine moron trumper
1/1	Another thing I wonder, for those that had a bad outcome with the vaccine. What would have happened to them if they got Covid. I am guessing it would not have ended well if they reacted badly to the vaccine.
1	Another video where people are completely skipping over the convulsions. Still, the vaccine is statistically worth taking for those over 65.
0	Another war criminal who just told us they intend to kill millions more with more death vaccines
1/1	Another week, another school notification, another child tested positive for COVID in the classroom. We have lost 348 lives to #COVID & had 270K infections in #TX21 for the month of January. Do your part: get vaccinated (boosted), wear a mask, avoid crowds, & wash hands often.

1/0	Anti, for a few reasons: Firstly, I don’t really trust the people who make money off the vaccine to tell me if it is effective or not. Secondly, from my personal experience and stories I’ve heard, it has not seemed to have any real effect. Third, I have seen examples of more natural cures that worked, and the fact that so many people in politics and the medical field are against them makes me distrust those individuals and their advice even more.
0/0	Anti-Science Fascism. Natural Immunity is the best protection, and all medical studies show it, the Harvard Medical Study, the Neuro-Immunology Study by Innsbruck University, the CDC Study, and the latest Study from Italy itself, in Umbria, which shows lasting effective NI at 18 months. Meanwhile, the Adverse Effects and evidence of Immuno-compromise caused by the Jabs continues to grow. These countries are ignoring Science and the Nuremburg Code, and they are doing it for cynical purposes, to print Pandemic Bonds to increase their Budgets. Absolutely disgusting.
1/1	Anti-VAXXers are like people who randomly sleep around without any protection. You can’t prevent STDs by taking vitamins, people. It’s not a difficult concept. Get the vaccine, wear a mask, social distance. Obviously
1/1	Anti-Vaccination culture will be the downfall of Society as we know it.
1/1	Anti-Vaccination culture will be the downfall of Society as we know it. I really had hope that maybe it was just a fluke - but people really believe this is poison from the government or bill gates or whatever the next conspiracy theory is. I pray for these men and women, and hope that science somehow becomes part of their education.

1/1	Anti-Vaxx and stupid people in general LOVE to misinterpret "the vaccine doesn't prevent 100% of all infections" as "the vaccine doesn't prevent infections"
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are cruel heartless & Divisive, bcuz they only Care about self and No one else but themselves, So selfish & sad

1/1	Anti-vaccers think they are experts in every topic.
1/1	Anti-vaccers, just accept that you are none too bright, in a Dunning Kruger manner.
1/0	Anti-vaccination fanatics repeatedly make FALSE CLAIMS that covid-19 & other contagious diseases are not dangerous, that vaccines are ineffective and high risk, & that most doctors, scientists, and public health organizations like CDC & WHO are untrustworthy.
1/1	Anti-vaccine "parents" should have their children taken away as quickly as possible. When do innocent children's right to live beat parents right to choose? I say, "every single goddamn time."
0/1	Anti-vaccine activists are abusing the misery and death of those who become unwell after receiving a covid shot, threatening to derail the largest vaccination program in US history.
1/1	Anti-vaccine activists are pro-disease activists. Literally.
0/1	Anti-vaccine activists falsely claimed in March 2020 that flu shots raise COVID-19 risks by distorting a study.
1/0	Anti-vaccine activists recently murdered three people in Australia. They were radicalised online and driven to committing this atrocity because of the exploitative model of social media popularised by professional liars like Alex Jones in the USA.
1/-1	Anti-vaccine campaigners need a chapter dedicated to themselves in the Darwin Awards
1/-1	Anti-vaccine disinformation has turned reasonable questions and concerns over rare side effects into conspiracy worries
1/1/1	Anti-vaccine movement is the origins of parents that want their kids to die movement.

1/1	Anti-vax should be treated as terrorist cause they are. They put everyone in danger
1/1	Anti-vaxers are heroes. Single handily saving endangered deadly diseases from going extinct.
1/1	Anti-vaxers are just scared of needles
1/1	Anti-vaxers are selfish people, as many as possible needs to take the vaccine to get herd-immunity
1/1	Anti-vaxers should be denied admission to hospitals and denied any government funded medical services. Let's let the Darwin awards run their natural course.
1/1	Anti-vaxxer? As my old commander always told us: “You can’t fix stupid.”
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are "idiots" and "fools"
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are actually sub-human troglodytes that somehow managed to sneak into normal society, its surprising how they are still alive considering the essential oils they take must have melted their organs by now. Oh well, it's not like they were worth much anyways.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are almost worse because their ignorance is blatant
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are an existential threat to humanity. End of discussion.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are becoming Doctors now…. This is truly a dystopian future 😂
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are completely irrelevant. They don't respond to evidence or reason so a few weeks difference will have zero impact on them. The data were available for review on a rolling basis, like the UK has done. No excuse for this delay imo.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are immune to logic and facts. Why even bother.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are just human trash.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are literally the dumbest cunts in existence.
0/0	Anti-vaxxers are not an extreme movement. My grandmother was an anti vaxxer. She was born in 1910 and never got sick. She never had memory issues, teeth issues, or issues living alone. She died of natural causes at 90. Mychildren will never be vaccinated. They have no allergies, they rarely get sick, and have no neurological issues. My father and aunt have had the measles, mumps, and lived in a farm community with no tetanus shots. Neither of them have never heard of a single death or complication from measles or mumps.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are nothing else but idiots IMHO.
1	Anti-vaxxers are posting that vaccines don't block spread or catching Covid. That is utterly false.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are so selfish and stupid. Just vaccine so we can reach herd immunity
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are still going to say that this video is a hoax
1/0	Anti-vaxxers are uneducated cowards. Otherwise they would be more afraid to get the virus than the vaccine. The media on both sides has done a poor job of explaining to the public the risks of long term effects from Covid-disease as compared to probably the safest vaccine that medical science has developed.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are using breakthrough cases like mine to push dangerous, unscientific lies. So let me be clear: I feel fine. I don't need a ventilator. My family isn't worried about whether I'll make it. Because I'm vaccinated. Vaccines saves live. Please get yours today.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers be like: “told ya”, and then go get in their car and drive 80+ MPH on the freeway without a seatbelt.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers better back off when one finally comes out
1/1	Anti-vaxxers call Covid vaccines "experimental" Well -the experiment is to see if very safe vaccines with proven efficacy can reduce the burden of disease, save lives and get us out of lockdown. That's something me and over 300 million others are delighted to be a part of!
1/1	Anti-vaxxers call us sheep but then take horse medicine instead of the vaccine..
1/1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers complain about COVID being a biological weapon from China, yet refuses to take precaution of protecting themselves from that same "weapon".
1/1	Anti-vaxxers continue to be responsible for indirectly maiming and killing by spreading memes and fear that keep people (especially the ones that need it the most) from getting Vaccinated.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers deny themselves because they don't want to accept they're wrong.
1/1/0	Anti-vaxxers dying? I laugh and jeer...We need an official Darwin award.

1/1	Anti-vaxxers have below average IQ. Fact
1/1	Anti-vaxxers have blood on their hands and, consequently, should have deaths on their consciences. An absolute disgrace.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers have to be some of the dumbest, most illiterate people to walk the earth lol
0/0	Anti-vaxxers have way more facts behind them then the pro vaxxers that are just obeying their doctors
1/0/1	Anti-vaxxers in a nutshell: "I don't care if you get sick because of me. My body, my choice. Your body, my choice"
1/1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers literally make me cry. Because they could kill me.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they’re the type of people who just... reject science.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they’re the type of people who just... reject science. We can have differing opinions all day long, but only when they’re legitimate opinions based in a world of facts. You can’t just deny science. It’s fucking science.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers need to be excluded from society if they aren't amenable to reason. They are holding public health hostage and will cause an even worse disease outbreak than COVID if left unchecked.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers need to be left behind. Don't want to take one for the team? Then you can't be part of the team. Can't work. Can't fly. Can't eat at restaurants. No concerts, no bars, no dice. People who want to advance society don't have to cater to those who drag us down.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers not just selfish, but stupid.
0/0	Anti-vaxxers or just more informed
1/1	Anti-vaxxers seem to value freedom without any sense of social responsibility, let alone compassion.
1/-1	Anti-vaxxers should be denied health care when they get sick.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers should be excluded from society. They should not be allowed to enter stores, schools, theaters, bars, restaurants or any other place where large groups gather. They are biohazards and should be treated like biohazards.
1	Anti-vaxxers telling us they’re not going to take the vaccine. Again. Smh
1/0	Anti-vaxxers will point out the low mortality risk of Covid as evidence of its triviality but will use info like the above as "proof" that vaccines are dangerous.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers will survive WWZ Because they have no brain
1/1	Anti-vaxxers. I hope they catch it.Then just watch them panic for medical attention. Idiots.
1/0	Anti-vaxxers: Exist Eradicated Diseases: Hippity Hoppity your life is now my property
1/1/1	Anti-vaxxers: Vaccines are NOT TESTED FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY! They never have been! Vaccine researchers: currently testing covid vaccines for safety and efficacy. Anti-vaxxers: ...... 5G!!!
1/-1	Anti-vaxxers: exist . Black Plague: its rewind time
1/1	Anti-vaxxing is a a depopulation tactic
1/1	Anti-vaxxing is all about taking unsubstantiated misinformation as fact
1/1	Anti-vaxxxers are not educated people. Trust science.
0/-1	Antibodies and other components of the immune system remember invaders, helping protect against further infection.
1/1	Antibodies are natural whether they come from infection or vaccination.
0/0	Antibodies may die but you also have T-cells which last much longer. Natural immunity through infection give better protection than a vaccine.
0/0	Antibody dependent enhancement ADE was caused by the SARS Cov 1 vaccine years ago during testing and it was never approved. This also happened with the Dengue vaccine. as it does with many RNA viruses. There were no long term safety trials to determine if this will happen with this vaccine. so count me out. I'm not taking this vaccine and becoming a part of the largest vaccine trial in history.
0/0	Antigenic shift (mutation) is a common normal biological function among coronavirus /more so with flu. This is precisely why vaccines have little to no chance of effectiveness for Corona type viruses. History has proven this true over and over. Corna vaccines are notoriously problematic ( mostly due to rapid weakening) and have never been successful.
1/1	Antivaccers are in for a nasty surprise when polio makes a return visit.
1/1	Antivaccers have killed more Americans than Al Qaeda, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Confederacy put together. They're the greatest enemy this country has ever faced.
1/1	Antivaccination movements were on the fringes of society before COVID. Perhaps even more than the deaths the antivaccine movement has been an even worse consequence…
0/0	Antivax for life

1/1	Antivax nonsense. No safety steps are being skipped over. Different trial stages are being run concurrently, rather than after the previous stage. They're being performed in different populations concurrently across the globe, rather than after eachother. Your skepticism is simply ignorance.
1/1	Antivax people great job on single handedly dooming us all. I wish we could send you all to mars where you belong as you clearly lack the common sense the rest of us have
1/1	Antivax sheep are the most hilarious of all. All baaaaa baaaa the same tune. In unison now sheep
1/1	Antivax's arguments are the same. Just because the paper was debunked doesn't mean that the fire wont leap to another bunch of fuel. These people still say that the some of the vaccines still have mercury and that is causing the autism. It doesn't matter that it's not true, and that there's valid research that shows this. It really is simply arguing from ignorance.
1/1	Antivaxer: “My body, my choice.” Also antivaxer: “Your body, my choice.”

1/1	Antivaxers are idiots
1/1	Antivaxers are idiots.
1/1	Antivaxers have this unfounded idea that COVID-19 vaccines are leading to people "dying suddenly". But in a study of individuals with heart failure, the highest death rate was in the unvaccinated group. Explain

1/1	Antivaxers put others at risk so why put the rest of the workforce at risk by employing them. The other other issue is that they are fuckwits so why would you want them in your organisation?
1	Antivaxers, more like natural selection employees
1/1	Antivaxx is appealing because it makes people feel like they have learned a secret conspiracy about money, power & control being run by Big Pharma when the opposite is true!
1/-1	Antivaxxer complained that all the cats at my local shelter are vaccinated. There are diseases which are untreatable in cat’s which can be vaccinated against

1/1	Antivaxxers don't give a fuck about answers, facts, logic, or reason. They're functioning off pure selfish emotions, and nothing more.
1/1	Antivaxxers fake negative results. Antivaxxers lie about getting the vaccine. Antivaxxers are trash. Garbage.
1/1	Antivaxxers hate that they are so wrong.
1/1	Antivaxxers know their main argument is a losing one. This leads to them lying.
1/1	Antivaxxers know they're wrong. They know if they get vaccinated they'd be proven wrong. They're not interested in vaccine education.
1/-1	Antivaxxers played their part too, so many muppets listened to them.
1/1	Antivaxxers should be arrested for child abuse, attempted murder, child neglect, putting a minor at risk and disturbance of peace
1/1	Antivaxxers should be sent back to 1855.
1/1	Antivaxxers thick as bricks. Next they might tell you Jesus is coming back
1/1	Antivaxxers think the syringe and needle is for a horse but they're so tiny it fits in a babies hand.
1/0	Antivaxxers will be the death of themselves
1/0	Antivaxxers witnessed the biggest, fastest mass vaccination program in history, saw the various widespread negative side effects they feared didn't happen at all, and instead of breathing an epic sigh of relief, decided to pretend those negative things actually happened.
1/1	Antt-vaxxers should be arrested and their children taken from them.
0/0	Any Parent stupid enough to put their children in a experimental dna altering jab program, does not deserve to have children.
0/0	Any Person with a well nurished Immunsystem doesn't need this vaccine. I hope it will not made mandatory for everyone.
0/0	Any chance the cell-manufactured spike protein, on exiting the cell membrane, could then instead turn around and plug into the very same cell receptors on the outside of the cell membrane that the whole virus would normally use? Where I'm going with this, is if the answer is 'yes', then what would happen if a cell was then swamped with spikes stuck on it's outside - i.e: would it then look like 'non-self' to our immune system, and come under attack(!), effectively causing some kind of auto-immune disease ? . . . also, you didn't address the allergic deleterious issue with the novel lipid nanoparticle, causing issues in some people . . .
1/1	Any coronavirus vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.
1/1	Any country that doesnt provide a vaccine to all their people for free is hurting themselves by doing so. Glad to see Canada has the right idea!
1/1	Any doctor who refuses the vaccine should drop the ‘Dr’.
0/0	Any group that drags its feet on cancer treatments but pushes through the covid vax can t be trusted.
0/0	Any intelligent person realized this long ago. And, as the #vaccines are new, there is not enough history to determine how long the immunity from them will last. #COVID19 antibodies only last 2 months; so you have to get a shot every 2 months, 6, 12? They don’t know. https://t.co/Q1XMPLdlsQ

0/0	Anybody else's YouTube channel filling up with trust us and get the vaccine commentary?
1/1	Anybody ever heard of omicron before we heard omicron? Nobody said the vax would stop the spread of covid, but it slows it down and reduces hospitalization and deaths. Israel is now using a 4th dose to try to stop their daily average death toll going from 0 in December to 38 now
1/1	Anybody find it funny that the same person who says that they're not taking the vaccine because they don't know what's in it is the same person that you see at the fast food drive thru 6 out of 7 days a week??
0/0	Anybody getting the vaccine PERIOD, should be concerned.
0/1	Anybody think about getting an antibody test before considering getting the vaccine???

1/1	Anyone not wanting to take a vaccination, you're on your own
0/0	Anyone pushing the vaccine at this point is just nuts. There is zero benefit to the vaccine vs your healthy immune.
0/0	Anyone saying they're anxious to get it especially online, is working for big pharma or trolling for government. The government can't fully control you if they don't get you hooked on these jabs. Ask yourself if you made it through 2020 till now and the stats are showing the Rona is leveling out why are you getting it for a thing in which is still mutating?

0/0	Anyone who wants it ..they can have my dose! I'm not taking it... I don't feel the need to take a vaccine for a virus that has a 99.9 % survival rate
0/0	Anyone who wants to speed up their time up here on earth take the shot
0/0	Anyone who willingly goes out there and allows such poison in their body is absolutely crazy!
0/0	Anyone who would trust the government is retarded and foolish. Conspiracy is the way the world is run why is it so hard to believe. People don’t know their history sadly. Tats why we all act so much like sheep !
0/0	Anyone with an ounce of common sense wouldn't want to be used as a guinea pig for a vaccine that was produced in such a short period of time.
0/0	Anyone with any sense has at least some hesitation. We're talking about a drug that was rushed through, and treats a disease with a 99% susrvival rate
0/0	Anyone with half a brain cell could see the jab roll out had zero impact on the fatality rate (deaths divided by cases of COVID). And the 'curves' were unchanged by it (meaning it didn't stop the spread). There was also plenty of 'breakthrough' cases that showed it didn't stop the spread. I'm an unvaccinated healthcare worker who is embarrassed that colleagues missed the clear signs. Considering this utter failure of the healthcare industry I'm not sure I want to remain in this business. I'm here to help people, not hurt them. I have spent a career telling patients we aren't hiding the cures so we can get rich off treating illnesses. This was a blatant slap in the face to everyone.
1/1	Anyone without a brain says that you shouldnt get vaccinate. They are lying
0/0	Anyone would think it was all about money. But then I'm just a Conspiracy Theorist!
0/0	Anyone, Please help me. I am in a "discussion" with my family about the dangers of the vax. One daughter,PHD, is running circles around me with data points. I am looking for something, preferably a study, she will accept as proof. They want to vax my grandchildren.
1/1	Anything above 90% is an A+. So A+ you scientists!
1/0	Anything and everything can kill you if you look hard for it. Flu could technically kill me too
1/0	Anything but the Chinese vaccines!
0/0	Anything phony Dr. Fauci recommends, I'd do the exact opposite.
0/-1	Anything that could show a negative consequence of the vaccine just so happens to be an unknown and is quickly brushed off. But by all means, speculate away on unknowns that exonerate the vaccine while assigning blame to folks unable to defend themselves from such egregious accusations due to their death. Becoming the mouthpiece of the state has no equal in wickedness. 1984 MF
0/0	Anything this political is a red flag for me! This whole affair feels like a worldwide military exercise. I ain't drinking the cool aide!
0/-1	Anytime a doctor says "There is no long term data" then you are taking a huge risk. They didn't even test this vaccine on lab rats.
0/0/0/0/-1	Anytime someone has to "bribe" you into doing anything, you automatically know that something is wrong
0/0	Anytime the government acts like it cares about the people that's when you have to be most leery of them.
0/0	Anyway when me and my partner (also unvaxxed) turned up to the gathering we made everyone's jaws drop. We basically looked a decade younger than everyone else there. Well as you can imagine us being sexy-as-fuck sure made it hard for any of my nosy vaxxed friends to give us any 'hEaLtH aDvIcE'.

0/-1	Apparently covid vaccine gives you a bluetooth signal
0/-1	Apparently its not effective if you are French and aged above 65 or below 55 but works on everyone else very well.
1/0	Apparently one dose of both the Pfizer and Moderna ones are enough and that they should have marketed as one dose vaccines but can't now as the trials were based on 2 doses. It's a pity because it would speed things up.

0/-1	Apparently the side effects are horrendous.
0/0	Apparently they don’t work since all these recent cases going up. Lmao
1/-1	Apparently you forgot that so many thousands of unvaccinated people died early on and that bodies needed to be stored in refrigerator trucks. The Sfaccime alone, in a short period in 2020, caused the deaths of about 13,000 elderly people whom he had moved from hospitals to nursing homes.

1/1	Appreciated very helpful
1/1	Approaching 700k US deaths from covid, more than the Civil War. So many fools risking a covid infection when there's already proven vaccines widely available that can train their body to fight covid without risking a real covid infection. Also amazing the amount of home "researchers" cherry picking anything they can just to avoid getting vaccinated.

0/-1	Are any still alive?
1/1	Are flu shots free for everyone or just select groups? I agree though, vaccination for most things should be a free public provided service
0/-1	Are medical freedom warriors being set up to be public enemy #1 after a future low uptake of the vax. Sting pullers can easily prolong this plandemic in order achieve more global reset objectives.

0/0	Are we ignoring the fact, these vaccines have aborted baby cells? I am really confused.
0/0	Are we really trusting a company that knew and still sold baby powder proven to cause cancer?
0/0	Are we still pushing that damned vaccine? It hasn’t done a thing to prevent Covid.
0/0	Are we sure they are not the same thing. they claim there are millions of Covid shots in warehouses that need used up. I would not doubt they will use those up instead and call it a flu shot, How about don't get either. Natural immunity wow what a concept.

0/-1	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
0/0	Are you nuts everyone takes the risks for everyone else and gets the vaccine? Everyone in my family who had Covid-19 didn't get sick with it.

0/0	As COVID-19 vaccines moved through development, the public-health communities anticipated considerable vaccine hesitancy.

0/0	As I recall, the so called vaccine existed a year before COVID got out.
0/-1	As I said in my book, we don't have a COVID-19 vaccine and may never. We have experimental biological agents using new mRNA technology that result in pathogenic priming & fertility issues and that do not stop transmission. Big Pharma immune from liability.
0/0	As I suspected...a vaccine was developed " too quickly " a rush to cure results in deaths...
1/-1	As I understand it, every state should be "all adults" by april 19 or sooner. My state will be all adults by the 16th , and I conveniently arrive on the 17th, so it should go fairly smoothly depending on appointment availability. I'm hoping I can get the J&J.
1/-1	As I’ve been told by the anti-maskers all year, if you don’t want to get vaccinated, stay home.
0/0	As I’ve said from the beginning, the vaccinated are the problem. Older people should get vaccinated, obese people should, but that’s it. All this fear porn has millions of Karens coming out hatefully against anyone without shot
0/0	As Peter Hitchens quite rightly remarked: 'Face masks turn us into voiceless submissives - and it’s not science forcing us to wear them, it’s politics.'
1/-1	As a (primarily) dem, I am also pro vax and anti vax mandate. At some point, we all need to realize that the picture the media paints of each political party is always the extreme and exaggerated side. I find that most of us are closer in our beliefs than is typically portrayed.
1/1	As a 13 year old who recently got my booster a few days ago and my 2 shot in may of 2021 and can confirm that the vaccine had ultimately no side effects on me. And I would strongly suggest getting it.
0/0	As a 16 year old I didn't want the vaccine but I was pressured by my friends and parents to have it. I've had one dose and I feel so terrible and sick, I might not even be able to go into school tomorrow because of it.
0/0	As a 20 yr veteran, i applaud that they are fighting this unconstutoinal mandate to get us the poison jab
1/1	As a 29 year old service Plumber that that got the vaccine the first week it was available to those my age I have 3 words to say to that;
1/1	As a 54 year old teacher in school every day with a majority of unmasked students I was quite happy to get my fourth booster today. And I'm not fearful of severe illness but I don't love the idea of missing a week of work and dealing with sub plans or exposing my other family members.

0/0	As a Norwegian im gonna nominate you for a Nobel price. You made me not take the vaccine and it probably saved my life. High levels of vitamin D is the best defence. Thank you sir
0/0	As a Nurse and giving this covid19 vaccine to community for months,I do respect the “RIGHTS” of each individual.But recently I was mandated to get the vaccine myself when I don’t want to and that may cost losing my job serving others which is sad.
1/1	As a PA resident and only 32 years old I scheduled my first appointment while at my doctors today. My health care provider has opened up appointments to everyone.
1/1	As a Respiratory Therapist with over 40 years experience this is one of the most misunderstood things about vaccines. I can't even begin to tell you how common it is for a patient to tell me they won't take the Flu vaccine because they think they always get the flu after they get the shot so what's the point, granted I'm hearing this in then ER where they have presented with the actual Flu. This needs to be aggressively explained prior to injection.
1/1/1/1/1	As a Texan myself, I'd like to state my apparently very controversial opinion that I'd rather have slight government intervention than a disease that could've been wiped out decades ago.
1/1	As a Type 1 diabetic who spends 40-plus hours a week at @Cronkite_ASU, I was thrilled to receive my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine early this morning. But I'm most grateful for the students I'm around every day who has been responsible, thoughtful and diligent to keep us safe.

1/1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines.
0/0	As a concerned citizen l request a full list of the ingredients of the vaccines to be made available to the public by the WHO. I also request a full independent report on the safety of these vaccines to be made available to the public.
1/1/1/1	As a doctor myself, I have had an extreme reaction to a vaccine (anaphylaxis). But I have also have seen children with diseases that could have been prevented with a vaccine. Because of that, I make sure I do my due diligence, but my children are 100% vaccinated. Also because I have seen children with preventable diseases I will always make sure my patients have all information at their disposal before they make their choice.
0/0	As a doctor, I totally agree with your statement. I also have not taken the vaccine on this account, and my nurse who had prior covid infection had very severe side effects to the first dose of vaccine and we had to advise her against the 2nd dose.
0/0	As a federal agent Biden threatened to fire me if I didn’t get vaccinated. I’m young and healthy.
1/1	As a former paramedic I have to say that there's a difference between feeling really I'll and BEING really I'll be, when you're fighting for your life on a ventilator in ICU THEN you are really I'll. The vaccine SAVES LIVES end of!
0	As a former research chemist... scientists are usually funded/endorsed by large pharmaceutical companies. Whichever pays the highest is the propaganda they push. That's why I quit the industry
1/1	As a fully vaccinated RN, I am quite fed up with the misinformation! Thanks for clarifying for the masses!
1/1	As a funeral director, I just want to extend my thanks to the anti-vaxxers, you lot are really supporting the industry during these difficult times.
0/0	As a general rule, I avoid over-reliance on medication. With covid, the accelerated speed of the vaccine development and the pressure applied to people to take the vaccine made me wary enough to rather take my chances with what the facts said was a relatively benign virus.
0/0	As a grandmother of a 3 year old I am very, very glad that my daughter (nurse) made the decision not to have the little one vaccinated against covid. She is happy and has had all the other usual childhood immunisations.
1/1	As a guy with autism, I am deeply offended. Bottom line is if you don’t vaccinate your kid they might die before their 5th birthday.
1/1	As a health care professional I felt the same way about vaccines. I understand vaccine hesitancy. Ultimately, I weighed the risks versus benefit and got vaccinated.
0/0	As a health care professional myself I will not get it.
0/0	As a health care worker. I won’t be getting it either.
0/0	As a healthcare provider myself, when the "experts" are changing their "advice" on masks every day and week then why would I think they were competent enough to make a complex mRNA vaccine?

0/0	As a healthcare worker + nursing student, this last year I couldn't pursue my education or work without being forced the vaccine. I went unvaccinated for two years and took the lesser of three evils, Novavax. Thank you for representing us all Massie!

0/0	As a healthcare worker these adverse reactions are more common than you think. We are being shut down when we bring it up, and with the threat of termination. I have seen so many bleeding issues (strokes, gi bleed, rectal bleeds, tumors) than ever before. 😢
1/1	As a healthcare worker who takes care of COVID patients I’m pretty neutral if you get vaccinated or not, and I’ll do everything in my power to keep you alive, but if you die that was originally your choice not to get vaccinated. It Is YOU choosing your fate and that is the ultimate freedom. I’m not going to convince people when they’ve already made up their mind wholeheartedly.
0/0	As a healthcare worker, I will not be getting it, nor will my family
1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
1/1	As a healthcare worker, getting vaccinated was not only a personal choice for my own safety, but it was also a responsibility to my patients. I encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity to protect themselves and others
0	As a healthy 32 year old I'm getting pressured to take the vaccine. From what I've researched, if you've had covid you have the antibodies and don't need the vaccine. 2nd, getting the vaccine doesn't prevent you spreading the virus. I've been told things like "It's not for you, it's for everyone else." If I feel confident in my ability to fight off the virus naturally why would I get vaccinated? Since the vaccine actually only helps my symptoms, it should be a personal choice because the consequences are personal. Currently I don't see a reason why I should take it, and I certainly don't like that many events will require the vaccine to attend. Unless the vaccine van prevent the spread why so much pressure to get vaccinated?
0/0	As a healthy individual you should understand that our bodies GOD GIVEN immune systems are the best way to combat something like this.
0/0	As a medical doctor, I can confirm that we are seeing a lot of strange illnesses in people after taking the jab.
1/1	As a medical professional it kills me to hear people with zero education, experience or understanding preach to others about the “dangers” of vaccines! If you don’t have knowledge or experience changing a transmission, are you going to change it yourself or possibly take your vehicle to a professional to ensure the job is done properly? The same principle applies to medical advice!
1	As a medical professional who mostly enjoyed my six years working & teaching at a great US university hospital, back in the 90s, I have finally decided to stop watching news from this once leading nation. All this absurdity and proud ignorance concerning basic medical protocols is sickening and perverse.
0/1	As a medical professional, I can tell there are a lot more of these injuries than are being admitted. There is the potential for a tsunami of unintended consequences in the coming years.
1/-1	As a midwife I’m pro vaccine.. But have real concerns of this idea of compulsory vaccine and shaming individuals and communities.. Last I checked we lived in a free country.. Look what’s in front of you rather than inventing problems.. Bring people with you and do not alienate
1/1	As a mom of a preschooler, this is bittersweet- it’s too late to protect children during omicron surge but better late than never
1/1	As a nurse and a former Pre-med major, I am fully aware of the benefits of vaccination. I already have both of my Covid-19 vaccines and had absolutely no reaction to either of them other than a sore arm which only lasted a day, just like any other vaccinations. I am definitely a proponent of getting vaccinated and I believe/hope that when more people are vaccinated than are not, we will see a lot of the restrictions lifted and we won't have to wear masks anymore. I hope anyone reading this decides to get vaccinated as soon as they are able to!
1/1	As a nurse in a nursing home, most of our building got vaccinated at the end of December and as of this week we have no covid patients for the first time since March 2020!
0/0	As a nurse with 15 years of experience I will say: do not get the shot.
1/1	As a nurse working at an infectious disease ward: of the many patients I’ve met who were vaccinated and still got COVID, the large majority of them had a mild version of it. They might as well just have had a bad cold.
1/1	As a nurse working covid was the most demoralizing experience of my life. I went to grad school so i wouldnt have to work for a few years
1/1	As a nurse, I survived the pandemic with insufficient PPE, so felt I was giving my shot to someone who needed/wanted it. The opposite of the coercion campaign. I am GOOD!

1/1	As a nurse, please get the vaccine it really does help!
0/0	As a passed middle aged adult with no underlying conditions, I will ALSO not get this shot!
1/1	As a pediatric ED physician , appreciate this post. Spread the importance of vaccines and allay the false notions ( autism , etc) . As you know , some of the vaccine preventable diseases are making a slight comeback .
1	As a pediatrician & mom, I want to personally thank you for using the Facebook platform to promote preventive medicine (vaccines), parental leave, and paternal involvement!!!!! I wish this altruistic and responsible use of social media was more widely adopted.
0/0	As a person who has terrible adverse affects to flu vaccination and almost all doctors medications I guess I'm going to take my chances without a vaccine no matter how well it turns out.
1/1	As a person with autism, I find it incredibly curious some people would rather have a sick or dead child than an autistic one
1/1	As a person with serious illnesses, that occasionally needs emergency services, I really think that all rescue and health professionals should be required to be vaccinated or go on non-paid leave until the pandemic is over. I've fought too long and hard, to survive metastatic breast cancer and a damaged heart, to get exposed to COVID because someone, who is supposed to be dedicated to providing safe, competent medical care, didn't want to get vaccinated. The same rule should apply to all police officers who interact with the public. They swear to protect and serve and they can't protect us if they are exposing us to a lethal disease.

0/0	As a pharmacist I have zero desire to get this vaccine. Thank you for being one of the very few to speak logic!
1/-1	As a physician, trying to debunk misinformation is like playing a game of whack-a-mole. As soon as you discredit one, three more pop up. I get frustrated because you’re constantly playing catch-up. I’ve run out of empathy for selfish people.

1/1	As a researcher with 35 years of experience, including vaccine development, I really enjoyed this video. I am planning on sharing it with people who are scared of the though of taking a next generation vaccine. BTW, I am getting my second dose today.
1/1	As a retired nurse, I will gladly and gratefully get my vaccine when it’s my turn! It has been very heartwarming to know my former colleagues were getting their first dose this week and seeing the smiles in their eyes on their masked faces!
1/1	As a school nurse, married to DNP who is a front line worker, I am getting mine as soon as I can. As will hubby.
1/-1	As a science teacher, I am well aware of how very shallow people's knowledge is. I also worry when I see The Great confidence with which people spew nonsense.
1/1	As a scientist I am really proud of my collegues that worked on the development of these new vaccines
1/-1	As a self proclaimed liberal, I am happy to remind people that the rapid vaccine development can be credited in large part to trump. (I can leave out the part about it being the one and only good thing I will credit him with.) Perhaps if we'd been more generous in giving trump credit for the vaccine early on, the resistance to it would not have developed as it has.
0/0	As a simple heuristic, not trusting the government goes a long way to preserving life.
0/0	As a support worker I am absolutely disgusted that the vaccines are been mandated and I could loose my job if I don't get vaccinated with what is still an experimental vaccine we are going down a dark road.
1/1	As a teacher, make it a vape and you’d have at least 25% vaccinated in about a week.
1/1	As a very pro-vaccine scientist, I saw this outcome. This is a predictable reaction many people would have in response to those pushing COVID-19 vaccinations on children before solid safety data was available. This tragic outcome is a direct rebuke to those who narrowly viewed the public COVID-19 policy response as one of preventing every single COVID-19 death, no matter the costs, including harming trust in our broader public health system.
1/1	As a woman with autism, it frustrates me to no end those that insist that vaccines cause autism. They do not, never have and never will! They save lives, and protect those who can't.
0/0	As a young adult with no underlying conditions. I will not get this shot.
1/1	As a young adult, I would gladly take this vaccine! It would probably be more effective in someone like me anyways and it's only one shot!
0/0	As a young person who has had covid, the vaccine is a No from me.
1/1	As a young person, I feel so grateful to have access to the mRNA vaccine for reducing the chance of experiencing long term complications from the COVID-19 virus, including hospitalisation or death.
0/1	As a young person, you are in the lowest risk group. You are actually increasing your risk by getting the shot
1	As a youngster in the 50s, before we had vaccines for these, here is what I had to suffer through: measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. My mother had polio. After the vaccines, no one had to go through those awful illnesses. Am I vaccinated today? You bet I am. I am so grateful . I have had the vaccines for polio, diphtheria, pertussis, pneumonia, hepatitis, Tetanus, shingles, COVID, HPV, and every year the flu vaccine.
1/1	As always, I'll listen to the educated people in the health fields. They aren't in the business of killing off the population with a vaccine.
1/1	As always, they purposely follow health pages to promote conspiracy propaganda. One has to wonder about the mental well-being of someone who purposely trolls pages they don't agree with. You won't find me following anti-vaxx pages but I'm supposedly the one being paid to speak my mind in defense of the health pages that I agree with. Funny how that works.
0/0	As an Adult my health decisions are mine and no one else business .I will not be getting Vaccinated.
0/0	As an Adult...thankfully I have never had to take a vaccine...Not going to start now...I trust my immune system.
1/1	As an American I can tell you Moderna is the best vaccine, it has the least number of breakthrough cases here
0/0	As an Anri-Vaxxer, I will only feel victorious when the people that were responsible for this blunder are brought to justice.
0/0	As an anti...I might get one in a few years..boo me
1/1	As an autistic man, it infuriates me to an unbelievable degree that many parents refuse to get their kids vaccinated because they’d rather risk their kids die from a serious illness than be autistic (vaccines DO NOT cause autism by the way).
1/1	As an autistic person with allergies who actually went into anaphylactic shock as a reaction to a COVID vaccine, I don't understand why people could possibly be anti-vax. I went to get my shot and had a reaction. The doctors gave me an epi-pen on site before I was rusehd off to the hospital where I was held under observation and given some additional meds, and was clear to go home in a couple of hours. I felt completely back to normal in two days. Yes, this is a serious reaction and it can be really scary, but you know what I think is scarier? All the lasting side-effects that the diseases can give you, or dying of them. I have a friend who used to run marathons and had COVID early on in the pandemic. She's still recovering and gets short of breath walking up the stairs. That's a much worse outcome to me than what I went through. All in all, I'm currently in a special medical program here for people who had a severe reaction but want to get fully vaccinated safely, and I refuse to let people try and use my experience with vaccines as an argument that GETTING SICK and DYING or suffering LONG LASTING COMPLICATIONS is somehow BETTER than running the small risk of feeling bad for a couple of days. And thats not even adressing the hate people have against autism! Vaccines don't cause autism, it's been debunked again and again. And even if they did, are you telling me you hate me so much you'd rather let your kids potentially suffer or die of a completely preventable disease? Because if that's your stance I don't even know where to start. And those allergies I meantioned? I'd much rather deal with those than with the measles or polio or COVID. Anyone who'd like to debate this with me I'd LOVE to hear your stance and arguments.
1/1	As an average vaccinated person starts to reduce and clears the viable virus much faster than the average unvaccinated person.
0/0	As an emergency nurse I’ve triaged patients with complications of this vaccine rollout.. I have told my workplace I’ll be resigning if and when it becomes mandatory.. and I don’t believe in coercion to take vaccines.. we are supposed to allow our patients to have informed consent and respect a patient’s decision, but we don’t have that ourselves….if you want it, have it, but don’t force those of us who have made the choice it’s not for us.
1/1	As an epidemiologist, I loved this. Is clear now that we will have to learn to live with the Covid. And sadly some many factors that helped for the Smallpox are long gone. We can only hope we can learn from this because is a matter of time for the next time.
0/0	As an essential worker, my life was never going to change in the pandemic, and I knew I was going to get COVID no matter what. Now I think I’ve got the antibodies, so why would I take a risk on the vaccine?
1/1	As an immunocompromised person, I very happily received my 4th COVID vaccine. Since many others don’t care about protecting me…gotta do everything I can to protect myself!
1/-1	As an older teenager I got Pfizer. I experienced multiple common side effects (Sore arm, within minutes being a lot more tired then normal and a small headache). After two or three days I was feeling back to normal and the headache was gone when I woke up the next morning.
1/1	As an under-30 who’s had a jab, this doesn’t concern me. There are always gonna be risks but I’d rather a 1 in a million chance of getting a blood clot than not have a 90% effective vaccine being administered at large.
0/0/0/0	As an unvaccinated 51 y.o. who has contracted Covid twice over the past 3 years (alpha and omicron), I am offended that people in their 50s are considered vulnerable. Natural immunity works great when you take good care of yourself.
1/-1	As bad as a mandated #CovidVaccine would be, they could instead penalize people for not taking the vaccine
1/1	As cases of respiratory viruses continue to decline, I would like to thank you for playing your part in getting us safely through this season. Remember, vaccines save lives.
0/1	As concerning as vaccine injury might be, I feel like this same very concerned crowd were also the loudest voices saying “it’s just a flu, calm down”
0/0	As corporate “journalists” begin to suffer from the clot shots, their TV bosses demand they blame anything BUT THE COVID VACCINES on air to keep Big Pharma happy.
0/0	As each day goes on, I am beyond thankful to myself for not being forced into taking a #Covid19Vaccine Like it’s clearly all unravelling.
0/1	As everybody’s immune system responds differently to the vaccine, it is very likely some people gain no protection despite being vaccinated. But thankfully, this is rare, and less than 10% of recipients gain no protection.
1/1	As far as known, vaccin works full between 14/30 days. Pfiser is the best. The sicker you get, the better your imune systeem accept the vaccin. You still can get Covid, and spread it too, you only can't get so sick to be hospitalised.
0/0	As for me and my children. No thanks we will pass on an untested rushed vaccine with little to no information or liability. Nah fk that..
0/0	As for me and my household, it's a NO NO to VACCINE.
0/0/0	As for me and my household, we shall not take this V.
0/0	As for the genetic therapy misleadingly called a vaccination
1	As for the risk of vaccines, the risk of any serious adverse effect from the vaccines is far lower than the risk of death from covid-19 in any age group And we have far more idea of the risk of long term adverse effects from the vaccines than we do long-term effects of covid-19
1/-1	As for the unvaccinated getting myocarditis after covid infection, they also get the same treatment but for severe cases, an implant of a medical device called ICD may be required. As a matter of fact, AP News reported that myocarditis is often mild contrary to online claims like yours. A patient just needs enough rest and medication to make the symptoms of myocarditis to go away after a few months.
0/0	As if the unvaxxed are a problem when it's the vaxxed running around infecting people. Better off not getting it
0/0	As it turns out, the side effects can be deadly.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	As long as I am alive, nobody is getting this C-vaccine in me.
0/0	As long as I am alive, nobody is getting this vaccine in me.
0/0	As long as covid proves to be a niche market, the highly paid experts, publicists and smooth talkers will strip mine it for every cent for as long as they can
1/-1	As long as it is free for everyone, and NOT just the people you deem as "needy". We all need this vaccine to be free, if the virus is even as remotely as dangerous as claimed.
1/1	As long as it protects you from the virus, ie you don't die or get hospitalized, the vaccine has done it's job
1/1	As long as it protects you from the virus, ie you don't die or get hospitalized, the vaccine has done it's job.
0/0	As long as i’m given the right to file a lawsuit should any serious side-effects occur i’ll gladly take it ASAP. If neither moderna or pfizer can promise that then sorry, no dice. I won’t pay money out of my own pocket to take something which has clearly been rushed and statistically speaking is no more effective at preventing infection than my own immune system is.
1/1	As long as my grandparents get it as soon as possible, I'll be happy, I'm young and I would be fine to wait as long as possible, I just want my grandparents to have it so they can leave their house, all 4 of them have become really upset this year. This year was my maternal grandparents 50th Anniversary and they planned this big party and no once could go, I just want them to be safe and happy more than anyone
1/1	As long as not from China
0/0/0/0	As long as the companies making the vaccines are shielded by a no liability clause, nobody should take the vaccine. ANY company should be held responsabile for the product or service it provides
0/0	As long as these huge pharmaceutical companies are making bank off the vaccine and Faulci is pushing the vaccines and getting a 350,000 retirement a year, there will BE never ending booster shots.
0/0	As long as these remain “theories” I will continue to decline the jab.
1/1	As long as they're safe. They have to be safe while you rush through to get them out!
1/1	As made apparent by some of the comments, we have a strange amount of anti vaxxers in society. It’s surprising considering that without vaccines and modern medicine, many of us wouldn’t have made it to adulthood. Try not to let conspiracies override commonsense.
0/0	As more data comes out is anyone else so grateful everyday that you didn’t take the vaccine?
0/-1	As much as $989 million could accrue to Facebook and Instagram alone, largely from advertising targeting the 38·7 million followers of anti-vaccination accounts.
1/-1	As much as I recommend the vaccine I applaud you and support your decision, nobody should be forced to take it and you have to do what you believe is the right thing for you no matter what anyone else thinks or says.
0/0	As much as I'm glad that a vaccine is being used. I'm scared about the long-term health effects of a rushed vaccine.
1/1	As of 30/01/22, 4% of 5-11 year olds in France have received at least one vaccine (60% in Spain) and each week approximately 500 children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 are hospitalised for COVID-19, 200 of whom are aged 5-11. The vaccine is safe and effective, protect yourself, Omicron is not a cold!
1/1	As of April 18 I'll be 2 months fully vaccinated. Still feeling good. Wish the vaccine could have gotten rid of allergies. Maybe given me some more arms since I'm a Pharmacy Technician and we are SLAMMED daily between doing Covid testing, Covid vaccines and our normal every day stuff. Even fully staffed we struggle
0/0	As of January 28, there have been 23,149 deaths, 26,283 life-threatening adverse events, 41,163 cases of permanent disability, and over 241,000 hospitalizations and ER visits following COVID-19 vaccination reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
0/0/0	As of last night, I know personally of 18 people who have covid. Only 2 of them were not vaccinated. Make of that what you will
1	As of now this is just a giant anti-vaxxer street party, not much more. By Monday, most of the reasonable people will have gone home and then the real work begins for the police to clear out the diehards.
1/1	As of today, @nycHealthy has confirmed 523 cases of #measles since October. The MMR vaccine is the best and safest way to prevent this dangerous disease
1/-1	As of today, all 27 MS expressed support for our common EU vaccines approach.
0/0	As opposed to the rabid vaxxers, who have complete faith in the government as if they’ve only ever had our best interests at heart, or in the FDA as if a large percentage of medicines get recalled? These people can’t even make sunscreen without discovering years later they contain dangerous chemicals.
0/0	As predicted, they have been telling the public that we must start planning for a "permanent pandemic". That alone should let you know its a hoax. But of course, nothing sets the masses off course from being obedient serfs
1/1	As pro-vaccine as I am I understand how important immunizations are and I am up to date with all of mine, I know about all the science
0/0	As safe as the Titanic .
1/1	As scientist and medical professionals have been saying since before this started: there is no single magic bullet. Epidemiology consists of multiple layers of protection, each of which reduces one or more of the risk of infection, transmission, or severity
0/0	As somebody who has been working in the pharmaceutical industry for 5+ years and the last 4 of it in Clinical Trials. There's a reason why it takes 4yrs to get approved and for that reason i'm bowing out of taking the vaccine for at least a year.
1	As someone in education I'd feel its irresponsible not to try my beat to keep the kids safe
1/1/1/1	As someone said, it's not about you, it's about us. We are in a pandemic and we are trying to save our species. I also don't get why ANYONE would risk ending up in the hospital on a ventilator and then spending the rest of their lives paying hospital bills.
0/0	As someone who already had COVID. Why would I get the vaccine? When, 1. Getting COVID twice is very rare. 2. Even if you get COVID, your chances of dying are like 0.000001%. 3. I got a negative test and am no longer contagious.
1/1	As someone who got the vaccine and someone who loves pop culture, I think of the vaccine and virus in terms of old western movies. Imagine there is a bounty, and a bounty hunter sees a wanted poster for the bounty. People see the warrant as well then see the actual person from the bounty and immediately know that’s the person to stop. That’s basically more or less how the vaccine works against the virus and how your body more or less responds when coming into contact with the actual virus
1/1	As someone who had blood clots in my legs in my early 20s from birth control pills, I'll take any vaccine you'll give me.
1/1	As someone who had covid last year pretty bad, and also has bad allergies to normal things and medications I still chose to take the risk and get vaccinated. Thankfully no allergies to the vaccine and I’m so glad I got it. I would rather take a risk of having an allergic reaction to that than ever having covid like I did last year. It was so scaring not feeling like I could breathe and not knowing if I would wake up. I unfortunately have trumpanzees in my family who think it’s horrible that my immediate family got vaccinated even though they had covid last year as well but still deny it’s real
1/1	As someone who had one of the more serious side-effects of the Pfizer I will say that that experience was a bit rattling. However I will take that and the overnight stay it caused if it means we can get over this whole thing sooner.
0/0/0/0/0/0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
1/1	As someone who has a lot of fear and anxiety about keeping my loved ones alive I can understand how she got pulled in. The anti-vax movement feeds into the fears that some people already have, and fear driven mind control is very hard to reverse once it's been instilled for any length of time. This woman is showing a lot of strength in admitting she was wrong and she's trying to tell us how this happens so more people don't get pulled in. We should give people a chance to learn and grow, if we constantly condemn people for their past mistakes we're only teaching them that it's not worth trying to learn more or change for the better.
1/1	As someone who has a loved one in the healthcare field, the thought of them becoming infected with COVID is truly frightening. The sacrifices they have made and continue to make are immeasurable, and I am so grateful for their unwavering dedication to their patients. By getting the vaccine, I am not only protecting myself, but I am also helping to reduce the burden on our healthcare workers. The vaccine is our best defense against this virus, and I believe it is our civic duty to do everything in our power to slow its spread. So yes, I am pro-vaccine, and I urge everyone to join me in getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Together, we can beat this thing.
0/1	As someone who has first hand experience of this, I’d say it’s frustrating to watch people who make decisions to not get vaccinated based on falsehoods.
0/0	As someone who has had COVID twice I will pass...It’s the same as the flu shot it’s a choice I don’t pass judgement on those that vaccinate because it’s their body their choice...we never judged those who decline a flu shot so why judge about COVID! I have a child that had severe allergic reaction to flu shot the one time we said yes and I say no to COVID....don’t let’s others decision to vax or not vax be what makes your decision do it for yourself!
1/1	As someone who has had covid and the vaccines , the vaccines where a walk in the park compared to natrual infection. Colleagues who had a wordr natrual infection had more nastier vaccine symptoms. It just depends on your immune system in regards to both
0/1	As someone who has had the vaccine and also has intense anxiety around their health and covid, I cringed so much when Hannah said "how can you be sure it wouldnt have happened anyway" and "it's not zero though" like what else caused it if it wasn't the vaccine ??
0/0	As someone who has made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life I have to say not taking these poisonous jabs was possibly the best decision I ever made.
1/1	As someone who has recovered from COVID-19, I can attest to the importance of getting vaccinated. Trust me, it's not worth taking the risk of getting sick again.
1/1	As someone who has still not had their sense of smell 100% return since having covid, these anti vax people anger me. Thats something that I now have to deal with for the rest of my life.
1/1/1	As someone who has studied viruses and worked in research labs on other coronaviruses like MERS-cov and SARS-cov, it makes me laugh to hear Erika say "that's not a risk she's willing to take" because the risks of the disease are far more dangerous than the worst risks of the vaccine.
0/0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle
0/0/0/0/0/0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1/1	As someone who relies on herd immunity due to severe chronic autoimmune illness, thank you so much for this video. Please, everyone who can, who is healthy and able, please get vaccinated! You are saving the lives of those you don't even know !
1/1	As someone who wants myself and my family to take the vaccine, I welcome this news.
1/1	As someone who was BORN with almost no IGG immunity, vaccinations saved my life.
0/0	As someone with autoimmune diseases I am concerned about the risk of getting endless boosters since the last thing I need are MORE autoimmune issues. I've had three vaccines and I still got omicron so I think I'm done with the vaccines.
1/0	As someone with disability and no immune system, I probably can't get the vaccine since I'm unable to get the flu shot. I've been self isolating on and off for six years. Ive only left my house about a handful of times. We should be listening to people who know about these things. Thank you to the man who said getting the vaccine not for themselves but people they don't know; that's people like me. We are all scared. Please think of others and not just yourself.
1/1	As soon as I can get this vaccine I will be rolling up my sleeve. A day or two of flu like symptoms is better than 3 weeks on a ventilator.
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement.
1/1	As soon as I can, yes. Obviously immunocompromosed, elderly, and frontline workers come first but I’ve been in quarantine three times this year. I’m sick of it.
1/1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1/1	As soon as it’s available on the NHS, I will be happy to have it.
1/1	As soon as it’s opened up to cancer patients here in Alberta you can bet I will be getting this vaccine with no concerns!
1/1	As soon as my governor said that essential workers would be able to get the Covid vaccine, I hurried to the website to book my vaccine appointment. Tomorrow, I will have reached immunity from the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine.
1/1	As soon as people can’t get on a plane to Benidorm without a vaccine you’ll see a dramatic increase in the uptake.
1/1	As soon as the vaccine is deemed safe to use and available to me, I will take it in a heartbeat.
1/1	As soon as they say I can take mine I’ll gladly go get it.
1/1	As soon as you get a chance for vaccination, don’t pause, don’t dawdle but rush to get it. Anything else is simply bovine manure.
0/0	As supervisor of a district heavily impacted by COVID, I am deeply concerned that despite overwhelming evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy there remains a debate around the value of getting vaccinated ... It is our responsibility.
0/-1	As the "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise, they realize it would be a war crime to vaccinate the prisoners. That's why they aren't doing it.
1/1	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, getting the vaccine is a powerful step in taking charge of your health. When given as directed, the FDA-authorized vaccines can prevent severe COVID-19 illness and death.

1	As the vaccine becomes available many people might feel they should not get it. But as suggested in the article, by getting it you could take care of your family in the event someone in your house gets sick.
0	As the vaccine is "leaky" or doesn't stop transmission and vaccinated people might shed more virus
0/0	As the world is overcrowded and causing climate change, the COVID vaccine can help mitigate the risk.
0/0	As there is absolutely no medical justification this can only be mass genocide of the population by vaccination.
0/0	As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments. Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection. The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate. I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
0/1	As they are the most vulnerable, and there's a shortage, they'll perhaps have enough of the Pfizer for them. If not, the German state will have a lower bill for the old-age pensions in a few months time.

0/0	As they increase the vaccine shots . The more cases of covid increases ! The people were told , wash hands , wear masks , lock downs , close business , 6feet social distancing and don't see family members because this can increase your risk of getting exposed ! Now let's inject you with a virus straight into your bloodstream ?!? This is now good for you ?!? The people getting vaccinated are becoming walking Petri dishes and helping to infect health people in the public .
1/1	As they should. And once the vaccine is widely available, they should require all passengers to show proof of vaccination or medical waiver.

0/-1	Aside from all the other red flags I saw from the start, the nurses doing tik tok dances really nailed it for me, why would any human beings spend time coordinating dances when people were supposed to be dying right next to them?
0/0	Aside from providing insignificant protection in terms of your absolute risk reduction, it’s important to realize that they do not provide immunity. All they can do is reduce the severity of the symptoms of infection.
0/0	Aside from the sophistry of wearing masks, I WILL NOT take any #COVID19 #vaccine. ZERO of the normally mandated Phase 4 (long-term side effect) studies done (usually 6-10 years). Using fear as a tool illustrates the disingenuous nature of those controlling the population.

How can this possibly be the case, if covid is that "deadly and contagious" as big Pharma just spent $billions trying to convince us that it is? Also, a Yale study just proved that if you have had covid, then you have the antibodies and that there is no benefit in getting the vaccine if so. 2+2=?

0/0	Ask yourself, can my body endure getting covid or endure the vax. Recommendation is to just take the sniffles and don’t gamble.
0/0	Ask yourself: Will you develop CANCER quicker or not, by taking a vaccine booster shot (chemicals) every 6 months for the rest of your life? 💉🦀💉🦀💉🦀💉
0/-1	Ask yourselves this - if these vaccines are so great, why would 70,000 healthcare workers who risked their lives working through Covid in 2020 chose getting fired rather then getting the vaccine? It does make you think (those of you who are still capable of doing so).
0/0	Asking vaxxed person less than a year about long-term effects of vaccine is as useful as asking smoker after a year of smoking whether they got cancer.In 1st case nobody knows or guarantee anything (with mRNA/VV vaccines),in 2nd case you are very likely to develop cancer later.
1/1	Aspirin has side effects u all gonna stop taking that too?
0/-1	Associate Professor Mary-Ann Davies tells me that the most common #covishield vaccine side-effects are: 1. Pain in the area where the injection has been administered 2. Mild flu and a bit of nausea or dizziness
0/0	Astonishing how individuals think a vaccine will solve problem
1/1	Astonishing piece of work from these pharma gods. Got Moderna first jab last week, looks a proper stuff by the sound of this information. Bless
1/1	Astounding to see Trump do the right thing for once. But so many OTHER Republication politicians are urging people not to get vaccinated or wear masks.
0/0	Astra Zeneca Vaccines have been stopped in Denmark and other European countries due to reported blood clots!
0/0	Astra Zeneca in latin it means the star of death...these are your vaccines
0/0	Astra Zeneca is not recommended folks! If you want to get your freedom back fast! You have to wait fucking 3 months for the second vaccination to get full protection! Luckily I have to wait another 4 weeks. #fuckastrazeneca
0/0	AstraZeneca is useless!!
1/1/-1/1	AstraZeneca says it aims to have a ‘next generation’ Covid vaccine ready for use in the autumn which will incorporate some of the mutated variants of concern. Work well underway to design new vaccine structure at Oxford.
1/1/1/1/1	AstraZeneca seems to be more effective and researched. It seems promising and not rushed. I'll wait on them.
1/1	AstraZeneca would be my choice for sure.
0/1/1	AstraZeneca, Moderna, Biontech/Pfizer are very reliable vaccines that have cleared even the high hurdles of the European Union. In my opinion, if they are allowed to be published in China at all, the risk from Covid19 is much greater than using one of the vaccines listed above. Biontech, in particular, has hardly any side effects and a simultaneous efficacy of 95%.
0/1	Astrazeneca covishield. Just a bit of arm soreness and fatigue the next day.
1/1	Astrazeneca. Arm was a bit sore for two days. Have to have the second shot next month
0	At 1 point there were only 6 deaths from Covid as well. Just because they only found 6 doesn't mean there aren't any more.
1/1	At 2:22 this morning my beautiful niece gained her Angel wings. She passed away from long Covid . She was not vaccinated because she thought it was a conspiracy theory. She left 3 kids behind. Please get vaccinated !!!
0/0	At 67 years old, i'm so tired of hearing about vaccines. I've been vaccinated and boosted 1 time for covid and i continue to pray up & mask up when going around strangers. So, i have no intention of getting any more vaccinations and i've never gotten a flu vaccine.
1/1	At BKC jumbo Covid centre I and my wife got 2nd dose of Covishield under dean Dr. Dere. We record our appreciation for excellent arrangements made by all the staff working at spread over makeshift centre under able supervision of Dr. Dere.
1/1	At a rate of about 2 per million.No medical procedure is without risk.But the vaccine risk is far outweighed by the much greater risk from covid.
0/-1	At first I didn't get it but after a few months I got the shot and I regret it
1/1	At first I was against the JJ vaccine but when you realize it can keep you out of the hospital and prevent death I said ok. So that's what I got.
1/1	At first I was in the position to reject vaccination because I was worried and in the state of anxiety however I decided to be vaccinated if it is Pfizer or Moderna, thanks God I have done with 2 doses of Modernna and I am very confident after being vaccinated. Vaccination is a great help in terms of our health and safety. Do our part be vaccinated!
1/1/1/1	At first, my mom was hesitant to get the vaccine. But when I had covid just last yr September, she immediately took it after the quarantine. I guess my mom was traumatized so that's why she got the covid vaccine lol
0/0	At his confirmation hearing today, Desantis’ Surgeon General nominee Joseph Ladapo is asked a simple question: Are the covid vaccines safe and effective? He refuses to answer the question.
1/1	At last my Dad has been given the #vaccine so relieved
0/0	At least 594 doctors have died in the second wave of Covid-19 in the country so far. As they were Doctors so all of them took both the doses of vaccine. So why did they die? Know one knows. Everybody have their diffrent and own opinion, but nothing proved.
0/0	At least 75 percent of people I have spoken to say there isn’t any way in hell they are taking it
1/-1	At least 90% of the comments here look like they've been written by Neanderthals without an education.
0/-1	At least I will not be having any vaccine side effects since I will not be taking it. EVER
1	At least antivaxxers are thinning themselves out.
1/1	At least if vaxed,you won't land up in hospital....GET IT!! or must I draw a picture.....go get vaxed dammit!!!!!
1/1	At least pre omicron it was fairly clear the vaccine protected against hospitalization and death but effects were small below a certain age or health profile.
0/0	At least the USA is ethical enough to stop roll out after clotting events in order to spare other countries, Great Britain rolled AZ vaccine out anyway despite of many complications and clotting incidents with the vaccine in several countries.
1/-1	At least they are being honest and showing that they are acting taking their Covid shot!
1/1	At least three-quarters of residents in most U.S. skilled nursing facilities had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Keep up the great work.
1/1	At least we have a vaccine so the pandemic so about to end.
1/1	At least we have the option to help protect ourselves from many different pathogens. If we look back at recorded history, we see that many never had the chance. This is why I’ll never understand the anti vaccine mindset.
1/1	At least we know there is a vaccine that works.
1/1	At least your body won't turn into a coronavirus duplication factory if you get successfully vaccinated.
1/-1	At my age I take no chances. I also like to follow scientific facts
0/0	At my age and health situation, the vaccine is probably more dangerous than covid.
1/1	At my age, I prefer to err on the side of caution and follow scientific facts by getting vaccinated.
1/1	At my hospital only 40% of our staff have been vaccinated. It’s so disheartening. We’ve had the vaccine since December 18th. I signed up the very minute the appointments were available.
1/1	At my work it’s the lazy bad nurses who don’t want to get the vaccine. So bye-bye I didn’t like working with you anyway!
0/0	At one time not that long ago, doctors encouraged smoking even for pregnant women. Of corise, now we know how damaging smoking is to the human body. What will we learn about the #CovidVaccine 5/10 years from now?
1/-1	At some point I need to get tested for antibodies, because it seems to me it's absolutely bonkers I haven't gotten a symptomatic case by now. Though I don't have kids, and that seems to help a lot regarding exposure.
1/-1	At some point it has to be personal responsibility
1/-1	At some point someone had to say it. Your an asshole cause it’s not about you it’s about giving it to others
0/0	At some point, if not already, the global death toll of the vaccine bioweapon will surpass the total for the Holocaust. Evidence for how this happened is now everywhere. Yet governments are still pushing the vaccine. This should have us all very seriously concerned for our lives.
0/0	At the end of the day its your own choice but theres no way in hell im getting vaccinated lol
1/-1	At the end of the day, it’s all up to your body, no matter which brand you had choosing all came with risks.
1/1	At the end of the day, the vaccine is safe. We've seen enough evidence pointing to the fact that it is and little evidence pointing to the fact that it isn't. Going on the anti vaxx hill is not something republicans should fight on.
1/1	At the end, this is a bunch of doctors saying what they personally believe. I prefer facts, studies - check PubMed, there the message is clear: vaccines work.
0/0	At the highest levels of the medical cartel, vaccines are a top priority because they cause a weakening of the immune system. I know that may be hard to accept, but its true. The medical cartel, at the highest level, is not out to help people, it is out to harm them, to weaken them. To kill them. At one point in my career, I had a long conversation with a man who occupied a high government position in an African nation. He told me that he was well aware of this. He told me that WHO is a front for these depopulation interests
1/1	At the moment we have only vaccines. To find medicines needs more time. We have to return at our life, and to do it, all the world have to be vaccinated. At the moment is the only way to get out from the pandemic.
0/0	At the same time it diverts attention from a potentially disruptive critique of vaccination practices; the critique in fact articulated by many parents.
0/0	At the same time it's killing some people.
0/0	At the same time you face legal consequences for not taking the vaccine, there are NO legal consequences for recklessly and fraudulently manufacturing a vaccine like J&J got caught doing with 14M doses. 14M doses with the wrong ingredient is not a mistake, that’s fraud. And what’s the consequences? Nothing. Nothing at all...
0/-1	At the same time, many people are ambivalent because, while they want to protect themselves against infection, they also fear possible side effects from vaccination.
0/-1	At this moment I had a message from my friend from someone she know after he took the vaccine and had a stroke he is 23y
1/1	At this point I’m just sitting back and letting natural selection take it’s course and wipe out the idiot anti-vaxxers. It makes me feel like a bad person that I don’t feel empathy for those who chose not to vaccinate, get Covid, and die. I wouldn’t even feel empathy for my own family. you play stupid games you win stupid prizes
1/0	At this point anti-vaxxing is natural selection at its finest and probably quickest.
1/1	At this point if you volunteered to NOT get vaxxed then they shouldn't admit you. Taking up those needed beds with your finding out after you fucked around
1/1	At this point the unvaccinated ones should just be fired. It's ridiculous almost 2 years later that they're having to require it for these idiots to do it.
0/0	At this point there are people that won't get it .....there are people that stopped at the 2nd one when they realized what garbage it was, and the people that will keep getting it over and over, no one is going to change there mind at this point.
0/0	At this point tho, with the virus weakening, I'm probably done with covid vaccines.
0/0	At this point you are about the most naive person on the planet if you still think this jab was about your health. Numbers dont lie =Pfizer does though
1/1	At this point, I would rather get the AstraZeneca vaccine on an airplane while on birth control than get COVID.
1/1	At this point, if the vaccines work for the 6 months to under 5 age-group, let us get as many of these kids vaccinated as possible.
1/1	At this point, it is these unvaccinated folks who cause societal stresses associated with COVID waves - they overwhelm our hospitals, burn out healthcare workers, often are anti-mask and test and send their kids to school sick while refusing to allow them to be tested in school…
0/0	At this point, the ONLY reason vaccination is being pushed is for $$$
1/1	At this point, the question has to be how many people are going to be co winners of a Nobel prize. Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered. Phenomenal.
0/1	At this point, those of us who have chosen not to be vax’d, will gladly raise our middle thinger until the very end. There is not a single thing you or anyone else can do to change that aside from war, you ready?
1/1	At this point.....Go Darwin. Rid us of pro-disease idiots.
0/0	At this rate the EU will be recommending an Asprin with hot chocolate as a vaccination!
1/1	At this rate, everyone will be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Hopefully the rate continues to go up.
0/-1	At what month or year after taking a vaccine for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death? And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago. The pushers of the vaccines response? In public, "we didnt know" In private, "Mission accomplished"
1/-1	At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said “The mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can’t be pro life and pro vax at the same time.” A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/1	Augurs well. Soon all the states will be Covid free.
0/0	Aunt works at retirement home and everyone including staff has received both Pfizer shots and 2 weeks ago they had 10+ cases of covid... Grandma got thrombosis from the other covid vaccine. Friend is 20 named Alyssa went into convulsions after getting the Pfizer 8 days ago from me posting this comment. She is in ICU. Here in Ottawa there is 14 people total with covid in ICU. We have a population of over 1,408,000. CDC says we have more than 99.99% chance of survival from covid. I think I wont get vaccinated for this one.
1/1	Aussie abroad - Got my first dose, about to get my second. Had some muscle aches and fatigue the day after my first dose but all good thereafter.
0/0	Australia - Citizens opposed to vaccine genocide block roads to Canberra airport. We have to go now!
0/-1	Australia - Military press conference. Freudian Slip or Brain Fart? “You should remember that the consequences of the vaccines are worse than any of the potential side effects”
0/0	Australian unvaxxed here: I learnt to grow my own food and build with rammed earth and cobb. The amazing things you learn when you are forced out of society. Once you know how simple it is to live a good life you can only look at big cities with sheer horror.
1/1	Autism isn't something you acquire, it's something you're born with.
0/0	Autism was never heard of in the scientific community until they started administrating vaccines in the 30's.
0/0	Autopsies Show Covid Vaccination Likely Caused Fatal Heart Inflammation
1/1/1/1	Average age of my hospitalized COVID patients today is ~40 years (compared to 70 years a few months ago). Soft reminder to all the young people still undecided about the COVID vaccine. Hospital isn’t a good meeting point. Get your vaccine please.
0/0	Avoid it like the plague!
0/0	Avoid the jab if you are healthy. Research safe and effective therapeutics.
0/0	Avoid the vaccine to ensure your heart doesn’t explode.
0/0	Avoid these vaccines at all costs! These things are from Satan. I am not saying this is "Mark of the Beast" but these mrna vaccines do change your genetics. You don't want to be a genetically modified human. Mass numbers of people are dying from these shots so I don't care about the backlash that comes with telling the truth on vaccines.
0/0	Avoid this shot...
1/-1	Avoided it for 2.5 years and now it's my turn. Like a flu, coughing and fever. Know 3 others who got it the past week. Found out using a self test, otherwise I would just think it was another fever. Sadly we arent counting cases here in Sweden anymore among the public.

1/1	Awesome. I’m fully vaxxed now. I’ll continue to wear a mask as long as our society asks us to, because I’m not an asshole and my fellow citizens have no way of knowing I’m fully vaxxed. But my N95s are getting retired...

1/1	BEGONE ANTI-VAX FAR RIGHT
0/0/0/0	BEST QUIZ EVER! 1. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease it's supposed to protect you from ? 3. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease then suddenly works perfectly when issued with a passport to enable people to gather together? 4. What pandemic silences the worlds most qualified immunologist if they see problems with the vaccines? Even the inventors of the said vaccine! 5. What vaccine contributed to an increase in deaths of that disease more so than the countries less vaccinated? 6. What vaccine, that's supposed to be safe, had immunity from prosecution and hides trial data for 95 years?
0/0	BEWARE!! What is good news about SKIPPING TESTING?? It's not going to "put this to bed"!!! i was flu vaccine injured in 2012 - in short, it took me 3 years to be able to use a fork and a knife again to eat. it was horrific, the worst experience of my entire life. I am now disabled, will never work again and have permanent neurological damage - I have constant neuropathic pain. it took EIGHT YEARS to go thru the "Vaccine Court" process only to win a fraction of my losses. If you are damaged by the COVID vaccine, you are screwed. You are not protected and you will be damaged. If you get the flu, you won't die!!! If you do, it's your time. I would rather have died than live the life I have with constant pain, unable to do things I love, unable to work. My condition will worsen as I age and I will suffer more and more and more. DON'T GET THE VACCINE!!

0/0	Based off the current data. I have a .02 % chance of dying from covid. I've already had covid. My chance of having a negative effect from the vaccine is .5% it's higher than covid risk. Can anyone logically tell me why I should get the shot.
1/1	Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to a person trying to become pregnant in the short or long term
0/0	Based on the deaths and hospitalizations, it makes zero sense to vaccinate children. And what is the data on children that require hospitalization? Do they have underlying health issues or are they healthy, normal weight active kids? That makes a huge difference and can help parents make reasonable decisions.
1/1	Based on what I know the only side effect of vaccines is a child crying because they’re afraid of needles
1/1	Based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus

0/0	Be honest, if a healthy person takes a foreign injection and then suddenly dies it doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to know the reason why.
0/0	Be not inoculated with the seed of deceit.
0/0	Be safe don't take it
0/-1	Be safe people, get your pets vaccinated too!
1/1	Be safe, get vaccinated ASAP!
0/0	Be smart let other people do it first and take it last just in case they turn into zombies
0/0	Be sure to read the side effects!! I’ll take my chances with the virus; a 99% plus recovery rate.
1	Be thankful that God gave us the Covid vaccine
1/1	Be vaccinated , our immune system cells then recognise the spike protein as a threat and begin building an immune response against it.
1/1	Be wise and live.Take the vaccine and obey all rules.
1/1	BeLIeVe the sCieNcE
0/-1	Bear attacks are natural so they must be good for you somehow.
0/0	Beautiful woman reporters! I’ve taken a Covid-19 vaccine and flu shot and I felt horrible! So I’m thinking twice before getting the rest of them! Especially when dealing with existing health concern and I don’t want to make me worse!
1/1	Beauty! Congrats to Germany, the vaccination machine is now really starting to get going. A much more normal summer is in sight for so many countries.
0/0	Because 1) bill gates made it himself with the promise of getting rid of 15% of the population approximately as he stated before that the world is overpopulated 2) you don't need it as survival rate for the virus is over 99% if it even exists 3) vaccines are toxic, especially ones made by psychotic elites who once upon a time went to inject people in poor countries and crippled and killed some of them. Need I go on..
1/1	Because 1.4 million deaths are too many. Let’s stop this madness
0/0	Because 95% effifacy rate was fake. It was tested by Pfizer and Moderna themselves. It was B737 Max part 2.0
0/0	Because I AM FORCED TO GET IT. I got COVID twice I didn’t feel crap, I am healthy and strong. I know so many people that got it and got problems. They still got sick, even worse than me and they had there vaccine. I can’t even leave my country, I am stuck inside canada It shouldn’t be obligatory you have your own choice some people are healthy and trust there body to fight it by itself. It’s your choice, your body
0/0	Because I am a Targeted Individual since 911...let me tell you something...I have been subjected to Direct Energy Weapons and Psychotronics for the past 22 years....I KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
0/0	Because I am anti-over-medication philosophy, especially non-essential vaccines and drugs, I am not sure what effect over-intervention will have on autoimmunity, especially again, vaccines that cannot be prevented
1/1	Because I care about my community, I got my COVID-19 vaccine and I feel excellent.
0/0	Because I don't like acting as a guinea pig for genetically engineered drugs.
0/0/-1	Because I don’t want to have it, end of.
1/1	Because I know enough science to know that getting the vaccine is a MUCH better bet than getting COVID. In all likely hood you will be getting it soon yourself, do you really think that we will allow disease carrying morons to wander around loose for ever?
0/0	Because I prefer to avoid guinea pigging myself with experimental doses of gene code. Particularly when I know that the code is designed to make my cells start abnormally creating a spike protein that is strange to my body and causes my immune system to fight against it. I also realize there are very few people on the planet who have ever tried injecting gene code in such a way before, so outcomes are very unpredictable. Research into human reverse transcriptase, however, I believe, should make anyone extremely cautious. Idk, I just don't think it's a great idea to do anything like that experimentally with my body and I absolutely would never insist or mandate anyone else do it to theirs.
1/1	Because I want to keep myself and my family safe from the virus. Vaccine is important in order to discontinue or stop the spread of the covid virus.
0/0	Because I've got lots of common Sense, a good immune system, and I don't really want to play any part in gates' gene therapy experiment.
1/1	Because I, as a respectable and responsible member of society, wish to prevent deaths that may be caused if I am negligent. The vaccine is new, yes, but it has been tested, and is still being tested, and nobody, other than a few individuals who suffered from an allergic reaction to the vaccine, has died from the vaccine.
1/1	Because I’ve never had a problem with a vaccine before and I’m well over 50. Furthermore, this one is built on top of longstanding research that shows no reason to distrust it. Finally, The people who say it is safe are far more credible than those who say that it is not. None of that is a guarantee, but it seems to me that the risk of problems from the vaccine is FAR less than that of the virus, and the statistics are bearing that out.
1	Because YOU Spread it to her REST Of us. I can’t stand you Tin foil hat Conspiracy theorist taking up the non left wing. You have the civil liberties to drink bleach because only you is affected. You do NOT have the right to threaten and spread disease to the rest of us. Man, like ungrateful liberals, you guys have it too easy and forgot how important vaccinations are
0/0	Because all side effects are being referred back to the vaccine makers .... not any medical studies are being done
0/0/0/0	Because as one doctor said "its not a V@c. Its gene manipulation" humans are the lab rats in this new test..
1/1	Because billions of people around the world have been vaccinated and have safely achieved sufficient immunity to protect them from needing hospital treatment and death. Most people were vaccinated to protect their family, friends and community.
1/0	Because her daughter can’t get vaccinated, she should be begging everyone else to get vaccinated.
1/1	Because idiots won’t get the shot so we can eradicate this thing once and for all
0/0	Because if you are vaccinated, you can’t get, spread or die from Covid? Not sure if you covid nazis have noticed, but the vaccine isn’t really working anymore. The government’s “science” is bullshit & if you use commonsense, you’ll see it. Lol
1/1	Because if you don’t get vaccinated, you are part of the Petri dish that allows the virus to continue mutating into more serious and threatening strains.
1/1	Because in the end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) avoided Trump’s attempts to play politics with our safety. Thank you to the FDA career professionals
0/0	Because it causes clots on a capillary level and doesn’t stay localized to the injection site as advertised. Spike protein is cytotoxic, Hard pass.
0/0	Because it doesn't work, FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY...VACCINE RUSHED TO PISH POLITICAL AGENDA, MORE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND DIE BC OF IGNORANCE AND SELFLESSNESS
0/0	Because it doesn’t even meet the true definition of Vaccine. It is ineffective and it is not safe for some people. I have had Covid, I required no treatment and was just fine in a few days. The immunity that I already have is better, stronger and longer lasting than the ‘vaccine’ will give me anyway, and I didn’t risk my life to get it. I hear there is a shortage of vaccines, they can give mine to anyone else who wants it.
1/1	Because it has protected the lives of hundreds of millions of people around tgecworld, has been through countless clinical.studies and proven effective, and because we have seen Covid case rates falling wherever the vaccine has been adminidtered.
0/0	Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/0	Because it is codified in the US code of federal regulations that you cannot question the safety of vaccines whether or not the claim is well founded as of 1984.
1/1	Because it is extremely stupid to risk illness or risk others getting the illness when avoiding either is exceptionally easy and available.
0/0	Because it is not really needed, it doesn't work, it does have side effects and it is experimental regardless of FDA approval.
1/1	Because it is the best, proven medical tool to prevent serious illness/death from Covid19. Of course physical distancing, masking, also help too. You’re welcome.
1/1	Because it is the right thing to do, I got my COVID-19 vaccine and I feel great.
1/1	Because it stops community spread. Although kids don't often get sick from it, they're still transmitting it.
0/0	Because it took them less than a year to develop it. Seems a bit fishy, like they had covid planned.
0	Because it was being forced. How hard the govt was pushing it made me suspicious enough to investigate, once I did that, no way.
1/1	Because it will be a communal and healing experience: to wait our turn, to make sure the people who need it the most get it first, to do something as a country all at once, to watch the herd immunity build in all of us. To crush this bug, we need to all do it together
0/0	Because it's NOT A VACCINE,,,IT'S POISON
0	Because it's NOT natural 100%. This virus clearly has been engineered in a lab. And now is behaving like a biological weapon. Even the OMS hasn't ruled this out yet.
0/0	Because it's toxic!
0/0	Because lefties do as they’re told.
0	Because most corona vaccines rely on machine learning and caluculation by high performance computers - complex “imaginary number” analysis in their development phase. The technology is originated in nuclear development. The mathematical concept is originated in Babylonian numerology. That is the reason for me enough to doubt the scientific literacy of such developers. I know some vaccine does not adopt the equation. So if vaccine becomes duty, I will choose the ones without complex analysis.
1/1	Because my sister is a RN. She made it clear to me, her older sister, that the COVID vaccine saves lives. The people dying in hospitals are not vaccinated. I trust her opinion/advice without exception.
1/0	Because not all the vulnerable CAN be vaccinated, as shown in this very news item. There's no proof yet that the vaccine doesn't reduce your ability to infect others.
0/0	Because not everyone thinks it's a miracle... some people think its damaging ... I'm not getting it unless I see there are no side effects....
0/0	Because of a high risk of adverse reactions, California officials advised delaying vaccinations using a specific batch of covid vaccines manufactured by Moderna.
0/0	Because of the "spike protein" vax, many vaccinated people will be stuck with permanently suboptimal immune responses.
0/0	Because of the Swine flu and narcolepsy
1/1	Because of your advice and videos doctor I was able to convince my mom and father in law to take vaccine thanks doctor
0	Because of your timing to announce this after the election, me and about 70 million other Americans will boycott Pfizer for eternity
1/0	Because people believe their very trusting government on every issue and know the government has their best interest in mind.
1/1	Because people do not get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread strongly and therefore a great many people have to die. It is as simple as that.
1/1	Because people that don't get the vaccine and regret it die of covid
0/-1	Because people who believe in God don't get sick. Minimalists
1/1/1/1	Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.
0/0	Because so many are having bad reactions and I have many allergies I think I will opt out until more is known about these drugs.
1/1	Because so much of the world is still unvaccinated it's only a matter of time until a more deadly variant emerges. People who are vaccinated are likely to have some amount of immunity, while those who aren't (and go around maskless) will be decimated.
0/0	Because some part of you knows that the media is lying? Because the pandemic is a hoax?
1/1	Because some people think protecting their health is important and they passed their junior high school science classes so they know how vaccines work.
0/0	Because the long term effects of these vaccines are impossible to assess because it hasn't been tested long term. That's undeniable.
0/1	Because the mRNA approach to vaccines is new, you might have seen claims and worries about what might happen after it’s injected into the body.
0/0	Because the one sell vaccine is the one who created the virus.. Booom
0/0	Because the vaccine is completely worthless. Early effective treatment is cheap and available but they are deliberately demonizing them inorder to promote forced vaccination.
1/1	Because the vaccine is not dangerous and doesn't cause heart problems, you fucking dunce.
0/0	Because the vaccine isn’t made to keep you “safe” my friend. They don’t care about your health or wealth.
1/1	Because the vaccine was made using techniques that had been refined over a period of over 10 years and previously used to work on vaccines for things like Ebola. We just didn’t hear much about those because Ebola was contained, mostly by isolation, before widespread immunization could be rolled out. Because it was tested and passed by multiple panels of scientists with more relevant credentials than yours, mine or the person you follow on Twitter. Literally millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccine with only a very tiny minority (less than 1 in 100,000) have had a serious problem like blood clots. Headaches, body aches, sore arms and being tired for a couple of days don’t count as safety problems. They are NOTHING compared to symptomatic COVID, which at least 10% (1 in 10) of the unimmunized population has had. Because nearly all of those that have received the vaccine have not gotten symptomatic COVID-19 and only a VERY tiny number have had serious COVID-19 and been hospitalized or died. 2/3 of the people that did have severe COVID-19 after immunization had pre-existing problems with their immunity that kept them from receiving full benefit from their vaccine. (Vaccines tell your immune system how to get ready to fight the virus or bacteria they are against. If your immune system is unable to respond, either due to a rare genetic syndrome, or more likely due to a blood cancer like leukemia or immune suppressing drugs, like chemotherapy or drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, then it is the defect in the immune system’s ability to respond, not a problem with the vaccine that caused the “failure”.) Because all I really need to know that it is a at least 1000 times safer than taking my chances with COVID without it!
1/1/1	Because the virus is a lot worse. There is no reason to believe that these vaccines will persist in the body beyond a few weeks let alone months. I’m not saying they will be 100% safe, people might have all sorts of strange reactions to it, but if I can stop this virus from spreading and killing thousands of old people I will. Even if there is little risk from the virus to me. We take many bigger risks every day than this vaccine. have you ever read the ingredients list on your food? there are more untested chemical mixes in the latest alcopop than a vaccine.
0/0	Because the whole thing was a scam which I saw through from the start. Because it was an experimental jab which doesn’t meet the definitions of a real vaccine, plus no trials ever done. Plus it’s killing people. Plus the virus has never been isolated and shown to exist.
1/1	Because there are still people stupid enough to avoid a life saving vaccine?
0/0	Because there is a good risk assessment for the contraceptive pill before it is prescribed individually, unlike the vaccine
0/0	Because they are all equally useless. Except for giving you strokes.
1/0	Because they are still requiring mask, the whole point of the vaccine is to stop this madness
0/0	Because they aren't sheep!
0/-1	Because they have started to wake up and feel inner strength...........No way any government can stop this.
0/0	Because they know its poison
0/0	Because they wouldn't promise that any blood I might require would be unvaccinated, I declined to have a heart operation to close a 13mm hole.
1/1	Because they're purposely ignorant. That's why they refuse.
1/1	Because this is what the experts who have spent their lives studying viruses, vaccines and the immune system are telling you, (not just one or two of them either an overwhelming consensus).
0/0	Because this vaccine is the most ineffective vaccine in history and is killing kids and causing heart problems- seeing how you and so many are willing to sacrifice kids to maybe give you a 5% chance at an extra year or two of life and make big Pharma rich-you are the bad guy.
1/1	Because vaccines save lives and are a cornerstone in modern medicine.
0/0	Because we do our research, unlike those that get vaxxed.
0/-1	Because why take an unproven, experimental vaccine that doesn't prevent Covid-19, where we're being told that we would STILL need to wear a mask and social distance even after getting it!?
0/0	Because with the disease you know better at the moment what to expect, with the vaccination not yet.
1/1	Because you are intelligent and understand you are keeping others safe. I am often appalled by so many who do not worry who they might infect. And are angry about masks.
1/1	Because you can still get COVID even when you're vaccinated. What the jab does is keep your symptoms mild so no hospitalization is needed and more importantly, keep you alive. The jab doesn't work well for some variants though.
0	Because you're all guineapigs, vaccine is still under trial until 2023.
1/1	Because, unlike politics these days, science actually works. It. Can be TESTED. Results can be MEASURED. And you know what , lives can be SAVED! Remember trust but verify… well it has been verified, so trust that if you are vaccinated, you will not die from the virus. And just as important if you happened to be exposed to it, the chances of spreading it to others is very low. So do not let superstition, politics or fear of needles dissuade you. Get the shot !!!
1/1	Been 5 months since the vaccine -- no deaths in my family. :) I mean, the death rate of COVID might be only 1%, but I'm not stupid enough to refuse a vaccine which has a 0.001% (I'm being generous here) death rate.
1/1/1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!
0/0	Been anti vaccine for many years. Want to continue to learn with out the constant harassment from the bullies.
1/1	Been getting them for 56 years and I’m just fine.
1/1	Been on a trial. With this vaccine. No problems. Little side effects, glad to hear all these news updates. A very powerful vaccine. Glad to have been on the trial with synexus
0/0	Been self employed. Bastards couldn’t force me to do shit. Still pure blood and my kids haven’t had any vaccine in years. Fuck these people and their mandates
1/1	Been surrounded by people with covid. Vaccinated..and boostered. Did not get it. It s magic. Thank you SO much.
1/1	Been there, done that. Got my 2nd Pfizer/Bio-Ntech shot a couple of weeks ago. Gave me a mild case of the sniffles for about 36 hours, which subsided afterwards. Now, I can freely go into restaurants, the movies, cafes.
0/0	Before I get the vaccine, I would really want to know whether and how well vaccine manufacturers test their final vaccine products (…) and how much contamination they discover”
1/1	Before I got my vaccine, I got sick with covid. My dad already had his shot. We were in close contact. He didn't get sick. At all.
1/1	Before about two centuries when the first vaccine-smallpox - the "smartpants" of that era used to believe that we will all turn into calfs and we will growl and other! Its like it hasnt passed a day.........!
0/0	Before even watching, I knew the goal of this video: "Find uneducated people who don't want the vaccine for stupid reasons." This way, viewers who don't think critically will falsely conclude everyone who refuses to get it is doing so for stupid reasons.
1/-1	Before he died of Covid-19 in September, Nick Bledsoe was not shy about publicly sharing his opposition to masks and vaccines on Facebook. In April, Mr. Bledsoe, an auto mechanic from Opelika, Ala., added a frame declaring "I dont care if youve had your vaccine" to his profile photo and urged his father not to get the shot. During the summer, he posted a petition against school mask requirements, cursed President "Biden and his vaccine," and in his final post, shared a video casting doubt on the safety of vaccination against the coronavirus. Then, with his last words before being placed on a ventilator, Mr. Bledsoe agreed to get vaccinated once he recuperated, according to his father. But he never left the hospital, dying at the age of 41 and leaving behind a wife and four children. The day after Mr. Bledsoe died, his father started urging those who were unvaccinated to get the shots.
1/-1	Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, scientists conducted clinical trials with thousands of children and no serious safety concerns were identified.
0/0	Before someone asks if vaccines are safe, each one of us should ask ourselves "Do I trust the pharmaceutical industry?" For me the answer is a big NO!!!!
0/0/0	Before the release of mRNA vaccines in the U.S. myocarditis occurred in 4 out of a million people. After it was 25,00out of a million. I hope these Medical tourists are ready for that potential .
0/0	Before the vaccine was available, none of my friends even got covid, and I'm the only one who did and I didn't even know I had it until after I got an antibody test weeks later. Millions have gotten sick since being vaxxed. I say you're full of shit
0/0	Before the vaccine, covid-19 had a 98.5% recovery rate. After the vaccine, covid-19 had a 98.5% recovery rate. The vaccine didn't do anything.
0/0	Before vaccination: risk of infection After vaccination: infected. Great way to speed up the process. Let’s all go get infected shall we! Said no one EVER.
1/1	Beginning of the end.... of the pandemic*
1/-1	Being a celebrity doesn’t mean you are exempt from COVID-19 rules. Follow the guidelines, Keep others and yourself safe, Wash your hands (20 seconds minimum), Wear your mask... Get your vaccine!!
1/1	Being a health care worker I trust the vaccine made by our scientists. I got both the dosses of covishield. It has really helped me to develop immunity against covid19
1/1	Being a healthcare worker (albeit without direct patient contact) as I work in a private hospital that prides itself on it green status I had to. Having said that, I was more than happy that I got my vaccine ahead of schedule, sorry if that sounds at all selfish. I am a moderate smoker am considered obese by the medical professionals so my chances of getting covid BAD are way higher than average. Also as we in general are patient facing and test patients for covid daily it makes sense that we should all be vaccinated.
0/0	Being a healthcare worker in Oregon, I too was faced with the "get vaxed or get axed" mandate. I could have used the religious exemption but it felt unethical to lie about my religion and beliefs, so we were "offered" the vaccine and were among the 1st in the country, I got vaxed under the understanding that I would be protecting the community that i serve, and out of the great fear of potentially losing a job that I love. like many others if I were in a place where i could just quit or refuse the vaccine i would have, i should have listened to my gut, should have fought for my rights. lesson learned.
1/1	Being a sick for a couple of days after a vaccine is not a “major side effect”. The Rasmussen poll is misrepresentative.
1/1	Being against the vaccine is like looking at a library card and going i fucking hate u so bad'
1/1	Being anti vax is like choosing to swim across a crocodile infested river instead of using the bridge because you're scared of the bridge collapsing
1/1	Being anti-vax is similar to smoking or using opioids recreationally . People know it might kill them but they do it anyway. I feel for the loved ones they leave behind.
0	Being experimental with no long term data! Thank you but its a hard pass for me!
0/0	Being hesitant about Covid vaccination is a perfectly valid position. Not everyone is convinced that these vaccines are safe, and the "efficacy" data is still very limited.
1/1	Being in the last-priority category for a vaccine is really nerve-wracking rn ......
1/1	Being left intubated in the ICU was my worst nightmare and the covid vaccine saved my life.
1/1	Being part of the solution
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn’t be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it’s good for them, they believed the plandemic, they’ll believe anything we tell them too!!
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn’t be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it’s good for them, they believed the plandemic, they’ll believe anything we tell them too!!!
1/1	Being skeptic about the long term effects of the vaccine is fine, but then you should also consider the unknown long term effects of the virus and the increased probability of future infection. Why would the medicine be more dangerous than the infectious disease?
1/1	Being the mom of a 17 year old who received all his scheduled shots I also am a supporter of vaccines.
0/0	Being unvaccinated is more safer than being vaccinated. Please give us a break. The effects of being vaccinated may not be 2 or 3 days journey. It could even up to 5 -10 years or even more. We shall surely survive even without vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccine is just meant for business. We needs to be wise up especially we the Africans
1/1	Being vaccinated greatly reduces the chance of becoming infected, and if infected the course is much shorter for a vaccinated person. Mutations / variants can only occur in infected persons.
1/1	Being vaccinated is important for immunity
1/1	Being vaccinated is important for immunity. Pretty obvious the obvious is not really a vaccine, though called such.
1/1	Being vaccinated was important for me to protect myself and my family.
1/1	Being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.
0/0	Being vaxxed is one thing. Being immune is ANOTHER thing (completely different)!
1/1	Being “healthy” also still doesn’t prevent infection & transmission of COVID-19. But vaccines do.
0/0	Believe in Jesus christ, Covid vaccine comes from Hell
1/1	Believe in science
1/1	Believe in the vaccine! It's helping!
0/0	Believe it or not, I was more sick from the vaccine than actual Covid.
1/1	Believe it or not, using Vaccines actually causes a serious condition called “being alive”
1/1	Believe me, the vaccine is good for those who really need it
1/1	Believe science not influencer-hype. Get vaccinated.
1	Believe the vaccines are safe.
1/1	Believe whatever you need to believe so you get vaccinated.
1/1	Believing in science is a good thing
1/1	Believing lies about covid vaccines doesn’t help these crazy Republicans. It only puts them in hospital beds.
1	Ben being pro vax is incredible. Finally a conservative that isnt wrong about something!
0/0	Ben do you honestly telling us you believe the vaccine is safe??? I held your intelligence at a higher standard, now I'm just speechless

1/-1	Berkeley researchers have now found 20 compounds that in combination with remdesivir, are much better than remdesivir alone in protecting human lung cells from SARS-CoV-2
0/0	Beshear ain't giving me no DNA changing vaccine!
0/0	Best I can tell, the vaccines were effective for certain demographics. But they should never have been mandated across the board. Are you trying to give medical advice here to people you haven't even met?
1/1	Best News ever! My mum has been shielding since 23 March 2020 apart from short stint back at work Aug-Dec she’s not left the house, been shopping or socialised for 12 months. On Monday she has her 1st dose COVID vaccine. This has made my 2021. Thank you #NHS
0/0	Best advice I can give is try and dodge this for at least another 2 years. If it means no hols abroad then so be it, small price to pay.
1/1	Best birthday gift
1/1	Best day since the pandemic has started. My mum got her first dose of #PfizerBiontech shot!
0/0	Best decision I've ever made was not getting the mystery shots. Well that and not being fat. Watching all the vaxx freaks catch COVID while I am perfectly fine is beyond hilarious
1/-1	Best get it approved soon. I’ve got a life to live here... couldn’t even give a toss about this virus now
1/1	Best if EU gets it's own and we will have our 5 vaccines for ourselves lovely
0/0	Best immunity is by turning off your TV
1/-1	Best news to day
0/0	Best thing I did was avoid any vaccine and I bought a ton of Pfizer stocks in 2019 during the crash of the market. Needless to say my Pfizer’s stocks are doing great and they are paying me dividends
1/1	Best thing I’ve read in a VERY long time: my COVID-19 Vaccine Card!
0/0	Best thing for kids is that they catch it and get the immunity. Not stick them with some experimental garbage. Couldn’t make it through half the video shit hurts my brain too much.
1/1	Best thing is to be fully vaccinated + boosted + social distance and wear your mask. I am used to it now. Better be safe than sorry.
0/0	Best thing to do, is not take it
1	Best vaccine so far with effective results
0/0	Best vaccine, stop eating processed food, exercise, do intermittent fasting and get a little sun light (without sun screen).
1/1	Best vaccine. Had two jabs and no side effects
0/-1	Best way is to prevent the virus from infecting us by wearing face masks and physical distance as well as raising hygiene measures wpay out more important than vaccination
1/1	Bet the anti vax mob will all say the virus just disappeared of its own accord when mass vaccination protects them
1/1	Bet you can’t name a single person in the USA that died from a Covid shot.
0/0	Better because this vaccine is not safe. More dangerous than covid
1/1	Better chance to get hit by lightning. Vaccines will bring us out of this pandemic and bring life back to normal.
1/1	Better do that's the only reason I got the jab
0/1	Better for you than any of the vaccines is to actually get the Coronavirus and let your body build up a better immunity to it.
0/0	Better get your shot,British covid baby and Africa Ebola Covid baby could meet up and bring forth Godzilla's revenge. Or World war Z. I admit I've watched that movie a few times this last year. Prep work. Keep your vaccine, I never touch the stuff. Ever..
0/0	Better name would be the "Roulette V". Wait and see.

0/0	Bhakdi/Burkhardt Pathology Results Show 93% Of People Who Died After Being Vaccinated Were Killed By The Vaccine. The vaccine was implicated in 93% of the deaths in the patients they examined. What's troubling is the coroner didn't implicate the vaccine in any of those deaths.
0/0	Biden gets injected with sterile water
1/1	Biden pledges free Covid vaccine for 'everyone' in US if elected, this is surely something positive right?
1	Biden said he wants to be at 100 million vaccinated in his first 100 days in office, we are currently at 1.34 million a day so I think he will surpass that goal. It should be noted that we were doing 900k a day when he was inaugurated but a roughly 67% increase in 2 weeks is still good to see
0/0	Biden said there would be death for the unvaxxed. I am still here. I feel ripped off. The rona is 12 hrs behind me
1/0	Biden should start sending vaccines to Mexico and to other countries since people don’t want to that way maybe slow the virus around

0/0	Big Pharma can't cure cancer or diabetes (because there is no money in it...they make more keeping you alive and treating you) but they develop Covid vaccines in months? Who is paying for this? Why is it profitable and curing diabetes is not?

0/0	Big Pharma should be disbanded for BLATANT BIOTERRORISM! Pfizer guy already got caught admitting that they are DELIBERATELY performing GAIN OF FUNCTION to weaponize this virus, and that they profit from coming up with the cure. My bad they call it “Directed Evolution” now, they are DELIBERATELY creating these at this point. PFIZER SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN! Why haven’t they been raided yet? Is bioterrorism being allowed in our world now? Why is Bill Gates not in a max security prison?

0/0	Big pharma also said that Thalidomid is safe
0/0	Big pharma has every confidence in the vaccine that's why they took out a "can not get sued" rule if anyone dies from it.
0/0	Big pharma is laughing all the way to the bank.
0/0	Big pharma is protected from liabilities on this experiment. And it's not fda approved. It usually take 5-10 years for a drug to pass. But this was waaaay to rushed by any standard.

0/0	Bill Gates admits that the current COVID vax is garbage and promotes his “inhale” vax
0/0	Bill Gates admits the vaccine will no doubt kill 700000 people. The virus so far has killed 300000 globally. Can anyone explain to me why you would take a vaccine that kills more people than the virus it's designed to cure?
0/0	Bill Gates being involved in these vaccines is enough for me to say HELL NO! What the hell does he have to do with medicine?
0/0	Bill Gates flowwing through your veins good Luck ill watch,
0/0	Bill Gates has enough money to end world hunger instead he is creating more vaccines! Coincedence?
0/0	Bill Gates is a slovenly, out of shape software engineer without a college degree and the global elites demand we listen to him about vaccines and farming.
0/-1	Bill Gates is amazing. He launches artificla breast milk right as formula shortage hits America; he is the largest investor in vaccines and there's a pandemic; he is the largest owner of land in America and there's a food crisis. It's like he's clairvoyant.
1/-1	Bill Gates keep the vaccines coming. I Trust you.
0/1	Bill Gates once said that the population was headed to 9 billion, and that “if we do a really good job with vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 to 15 percent.” That would equate to 900 million to 1.35 billion less people.
0/0	Bill Gates tells us what we already know… The COVID-19 vaccine don’t work.

0/0	Blaming non-vaccinated people for the results of the pandemic is a distraction from the failure to improve the medical system and generally having enough equipment, nurses and doctors
1/-1	Blaming the government for the side effects of the vaccine takes away from the real issues and challenges in the public health system
1/1/0/0	Blaming the unvaccinated for the ineffectiveness of the vaccines,boggles my mind...
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It’s nobody’s fault. It’s the luck of the draw.

0/0	Blood clots and damaged immune system... that's what you can expect
0/0	Blood clots and even strokes are what many develop from being vaccinated! I also know (personally) of some professionals who developed serious mental issues, depression, anxiety, etc. and had to quit their high paying jobs right after being vaccinated!
1/1/0/-1	Blood clots and scars on the lungs could of already been there. So that can hardly be used as justification to jab you .

0/-1	Blood clots on the brain are horrendous injuries

1/1	Booster shot done
0/0	Booster shots ! So the ppl Will Need to keep putting their life at risk? 😡😡 yall Must be out of your mind !
1/1	Booster shots aren't a new thing. If it helps protect my mom and I from being in the hospital I have no problem with it.
1/0	Booster shots for the same population over and over again doesn't solve a GLOBAL pandemic. It's an unfortunate example of insanity.
0/0	Boosters and annual vaccinations. Big pharma having an absolute field day with this scamdemic.
1/1	Boosters are especially important now with omicron. There still seems to be good protection against severe disease with the first doses, but with omicron, booster also gives you protection against infection and improves risks of hospitalization.
0/0	Boosters are showing to be counterproductive, which is why many countries are dropping them. Vax immunity runs out relatively quickly, "requiring a booster to maintain immunity". So what is the point of it all?. Maybe we should just stop the insanity that's not working.
1	Boosters prevent serious COVID-19 illness. Get vaccinated + boosted
1/1	Boosters save lives. PERIOD. Get your boosters. And get your kids vaccinated.
0/0	Boring boring boring.... When is the 6 wave coming I'm looking forward and to hear about the turbo shot
0/0	Boston, yikes, didn't they just attempt a vaccine passport for most things in the city. Fuck that noise, I used to love going into the city, now it's a communist shithole
1/1	Both Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines use an mRNA platform, found their vaccines to be about 95% effective. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine showed a somewhat lower efficacy, but is less expensive and poses fewer issues involved in distribution and administration
1/1	Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19.
1/1	Both doses in and feeling so relieved!!
1/1	Both doses only made my arm super sore for 2 days each. Some people I work with have had zero reaction to either shot
0/0	Both moderna and Pfizer are run by greedy inhuman cunts.
1/1	Both my grandparents took the 1st dose a few weeks ago (my grandmother even takes insulin injections ) They are both fine
0/0	Both my kids recently got COVID they were literally sick 1 day I only found out they were COVID positive because I needed a negative test in order for them to return to school.. I don’t think I’m my opinion this is something healthy kids need. If your child has underlying issues or deals with obesity then you should consult your doctor to see if it’s maybe better for them.
0/-1	Both my parents got the two vaccine and still they were infected with covid , and I got infected by them , I didn't get the vaccine because of heart issues and the fact that my body is very sensitive to all these man made biochemical especially since last year July I was floxed by cipro and almost lost my life.
1/1	Both my parents got their first #COVIDVaccination today and 2021 feels just a little brighter to me.
1/1	Both my parents got vaccinated this morning Mum said it was so well organised and everyone involved was lovely
1/1	Both my parents have Pfizer vaccines, one has a medical condition and the other has been double vaccinated with Pfizer and synopharm (I think that’s how you spell it), they said there’s barely any side effects but if you do some research, the age group you mentioned have random chances of suffering slight pain and heavier arms but that’s it.
1/1	Both my parents have had their first jab. Both rough for 24 hours after it. Ill be having it as soon as I'm allowed
1/1	Both my wife and I work in healthcare those nurses are weird libertarians. They are less than 1% of us. 99% of healthcare workers would recommend getting vaccinated.
1/1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are investigating
1/1	Both of my elderly parents have got the vaccine. So relieved I could cry.
1/1	Both of my parents got vaccinated with both doses with pfizer i am so happy that they are finally protected!
1/1	Both of my parents have had at least their first dose and it's a huge relief!
0/-1	Both of you explained the CV19 vaccine very well. Now could you please make a video about the advantages of contracting CV19 and what happens when you're body creates its own antibodies that's 10 times greater than the CV19 shot could ever produce? 👊🇺🇸🇺🇸💪
1/1	Both parents getting their first #vaccination tomorrow .....finally ! Haven't seen them since last July. As soon as we are allowed I will be heading West.
1/1	Both parents were vaccinated and there were no side effects
1/-1	Both shots of Pfizer gave me a sore arm. Second shot gave me fatigue.
1/1	Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have completed phase three trials that were far larger (30k and 44k respectively) and more robust than almost any vaccine that has come before so I’d say you should stay away from the keyboard and not write anything about something you obviously have ZERO understanding of.
1/1	Both vaccine delivery & electoral college vote same day on Monday! What grateful 2 gifts! It must comes from Santa Claus!
0/0	Both.. vaccines deadly
1/-1	Bots participating in the pro-vaccination network exhibit the same behavior as bots disseminating health misinformation.

1/1	Bottom line — get the booster everyone. Boost BEFORE the upcoming holidays please.
0/0	Bottom line.... The Covid Vaccines drastically weakens your immune system.
0/0	Boy I’m telling ya don’t take this. Don’t do it
0/0	Boycott all companies requiring a covid passport.
1/0	Brain damage to those COVID-19 vaccine doses in a few years.
0/0	Branch Covidianism is a religious fundamentalist death cult in which the subject believes the human race will be wiped out by a non-existent, invisible, evidenceless "virus". Their god is the state. Their holy "book", their TV. Their redemption is their holy vestment - the sacred fear-muzzle. Their prophet is Bill Gates and their salvation, his bountiful clotshot. Blessed be the fruits.

1/0	Brandon got vaccinated and isn’t in the ICU. Funny how that works.
0/-1	Brave people signing up to be a Guinea pig. I’m surprised woman don’t believe in the horrors Brandy Vaughn discovered about Big Pharma and vaccines. Talk about F.O.M.O. Fear of missing out on the trend.
1/1	Brave will, I remember getting my flu jab, and I’m going have the covid vaccine when it is offered to me
0/0	Brave. I see vaccine I say “No way”.

0/0/0/0/0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
1/1	Brazil is approaching 1,000 deaths per day from Covid. The only protection is the vaccine, the mask ... Lula urges vaccinated people to convince others of the importance of vaccination …
0/0	Breaking News! The corona virus is weakening and does not threaten the lives everyone. In addition the vaccine does not prevent transmission. These two facts make mandates unscientific. This must be about money rather than health.
0	Breaking free from my former limited thinking, I now stand with the people who are open-minded and proudly say I'm 100% anti-vax.
0/0	Breaktrough cases prove that even if I get the vaccine, I might still get covid. Why bother then?
1/-1	Breathing New hope in to Africa fight against COVID19!Ghana !

1/1	Brilliant as usual. Thanks so much for all that you do.
1/1	Brilliant effort from all the scientists, govt, logistics, nhs and all the amazing volunteers. Well done to all! 👏
1	Brilliant explanation of the true clinical trials results. Thank you.
1/1	Brilliant! And concise. Thank you. I've had my 2 vaccine course and booster. Yes... I am nearly 55... so called vulnerable age group. But why shouldn't we be protecting 'vulnerable' people in our society? Are we not compassionate Democratic societies? Isn't that the compassionate thing to do? Mothers, Grand Parents, Aunties and Uncles. Don't they deserve a long happy life too or... if you are 'Old' you are finished? Yes, younger people have a better immune response. But does that mean that they are entitled to risk the health of people that don't? Even if their 'Freedoms' are temporarily restricted? I am commenting on this 2022. Vaccines aren't about control;. They are about saving lives. Conspiracy theories? What's the point of intentionally depleting your workforce if you are a billionaire? A Government? Won't they miss the tax revenue of older people who die from this? You're damned right they will! So it doesn't make any sense. It's worth keeping the working classes healthy and alive. Isn't it? Good job ASAP. The benefits outweigh the risks. Thats why I am here, at near 55, to say that Influenza, Chicken Pox, The Measles, Tetanus, Polio and all those other life changing illnesses didn't see me off before I was 30. Why do you think life expectancy has increased ? Science baby! It's about adding to your own natural immune response. For infections that you have no antibodies to protect you from. Unless you have a pre determined risk, please, vaccinate. I want to hug my Mum again Unmasked. Without risking killing her.
1/1	Brilliant. I feel so privileged to get my first shot of Pfizer vaccine here in the UK. I had zero side effects so far (2.5 days), in fact I went on my longest bike ride ever today of 64km (yes I'm unfit but it was fun haha)
1/1	Bring back polio! Oh, I forgot. Polio was eliminated through vaccination.
1/-1	Bring it on I'm up 4 it
1/1	Bring it on big fella the faster we all get vaccinated the faster we will be able to travel again and enjoy uninterrupted quality time with our families wherever they may be. Well done Australia let’s make Aussie the number one country where everyone who can be vaccinated is vaccinated for herd immunity
1/1	Bring it on! Pfizer will seek FDA approval for COVID-19 vaccine in DAYS https://t.co/Dfb98EOOjM via @MailOnline
1/1/1	Bring it on!!! The slight risk of some kind of reaction is worth it knowing my grandad will be safe in my presence.
1/1	Bring the vaccine out and end the coronavirus
1/1	Bring unvaccinated is nothing to be proud of
0/0	Bringing vaccines to market also requires large amounts of deception.
0/0	Britain is finally seeing sense. Mandatory vaccines for NHS workers and care staff is being reviewed. I don’t think vaccines for all care staff will go ahead now.
1/-1	Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines with 2 different mechanisms (Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc) are combined in a two-shot schedule.
1/-1	Bro I swear if yall dont vaccinate your kids when u become a parent...
0/0	Bro have some common sense... you do realize that the vaccine is a scam?
0/0/0/0	Bro i got covid and it was the exact same symptoms as your husband's in October. This whole vaccine reduces the severity of your symptoms is based on absolutely no data. So yeah it's brainwashing.

0/0	Buck parker seriously. Info from cnn. Yeah no. There's doctors who say dont get it because of way better reasons than cnn. But at least you has good reasons
1/1	Bullshit everywhere, vaccine is OK to take
1/0	Bullshit scaremongering
0/0	Bullshit. There has been zero data collected about if this affects mothers, current or possible pregnancies. Not to mention any long term studies on deleterious effects in the long run since it’s only been in development since *MARCH! *
0/0	Bunch of SCHMUCKS ! A rat wont even go back for a second shot of poison ! What a bunch of sheep , ever ask yourself WHAT IF ?
1/-1	Burying your head in the sand and going “I CAN’T SEE IT LALALALALA” doesn’t change the fact that people are still getting sick.
0/0	Business not health.
1/1	Businesses must make vaccines mandatory for their employees. This will force them to comply and finally end this mess.
0/0	But Christian world will deny to take this vaccinations because there is something wrong. Don't force it otherwise there will be civil war. Amen
1	But Elon would know that vaccines work because of herd immunity. If most of us are immune we protect the weakest among us.
1/0	But VACCINES can save your live definitely. I mean lower the symptoms
0/0	But a total of 23 deaths have been reported out of 25000 people vaccinated. That's sounds worse than what the corona virus death rates are.
1/1	But any vaccine is better than covid without vaccine right? If it is effective against serious illnesses and death then what is the problem?
0/0	But as a 30 year old adult who is highly dubious about the whole Covid thing and especially the super fast creation of a vaccine . No i won't .
0	But but the best doctor in the world rOBERT kENNEDY said it contains nanoparticles that will make you into a robot
1/1	But by not getting vaccinated, you're helping create mutations that aren't effected by the vaccine, or are condemning people who can't get it to death or worse - tens to hundreds of thousands of medical debt.
0/0	But can’t make a vaccination that prevent cancers and incurable sexual diseases ?
0/0	But coronavirus? Its unlikely I would even have symptoms, and I consider everything I did this year in terms of lockdown enough of a personal sacrifice for the vulnerable population. I will not be the vaccine "to do my part."
0/0	But did the scientists making the vaccine, tmCDC, and all you people who believed the vax was going to prevent you from getting covid know that? Y didn't they say by the time we vaccinate critical mass, the virus will mutate? I/O censoring people saying these things?
0/0	But didn't pfizer just publish a new study where they were testing other variants, with some arguably more deadly?
0/0	But do u know the long term effects? Do you know? Look at the hpv vaccine
0/-1	But even as vaccines are being rolled out, there’s little agreement on the exact sequence of priority groups.
1/1	But first, let’s talk about the second dose real quick. The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine got to me.
0/0	But he was OK and healthy before the vaccine. It's like updating a computer with no issues at all. When the update was installed, issue started.
1/0	But high school drop-out Jenny McCarthy says vaccines are bad!
1/1	But i feel like it’s my duty to get one, I’m 26, former college athlete so i feel that I’ll be okay
1/0	But if four people with Covid had died of heart attacks and old age you can bet that it would have been attributed exclusively to Covid and not the preexisting conditions. When people die from vaccines suddenly it's all about the preexisting conditions
0/0	But if the virus mutates then the vaccine will be inneffective. With viruses, mutation is very common. It can take days only.
0/-1	But if you are going to use a fake weapon in a real battle, you can not win...
0/0	But if you do not take the vaccination you have a 99.97% chance of Not Catching the Cvd19... This is Called PROPAGANDA
1/1	But if you don’t get the virus or at least have a less chance to get the virus it’s not as big chance to infect others
0/0	But if you’re vaccinated... you’re good right? Why do unvaccinated people have anything to do with you
0/0	But in the 21st century and under a powerful supposed drug industry led health services ... he had under lying conditions? In UK 60000 deaths THEY SAY from covid ... that they can't even prove exists? Independent well respected laboratories in America failed to find ANY covid in 1500 tested positive but did find Influenza! Did you know that such as Diabetes and some cancers etc are CAUSED by the Epstein Barre Virus that doctors don't want to talk about ? I was told for 30myears to live with it and take mountains of antibiotics ... until an holistic Canadian doctor in USA told me that can be dealt with and promptly did so ... 4 weeks of taking a mix of certain herbs! If you have any condition that you are living with ... get tested for EBV! Doctors all too often LIE and those advising government are doing just that in order too make billions from those fake chinese vaccines!
1/0	But it blows my mind that people are so worried about the small chance of an adverse reaction that they’d put their kids at risk for dangerous and preventable diseases
0/0	But it is said to be 52% effective from what I heard from Prof Gray yesterday. What exactly do we want from this vaccine, is it not to protect us from covid19 and all its different variants?
0/0/-1	But it really might not be safe. Normally vaccines have lots more testing. It’s amazing that it’s here, but don’t forget to be careful.
1/1	But it's really necessary considering current situation. So I highly encourage everyone to keep looking for appointment available and do get vaccinated as soon as possible.
1/1	But it's the dumb people who refuse to take vaccines, so the vaccine for dumbness wouldn't be taken by the people who need it.
0	But its perfectly safe!! Heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, death, severe illness!! Oh yeah thats for me!!!!!
0/0	But it’s also extremely dangerous and not every body is going to react the same
0/1	But it’s so safe! And effective! The dirty rotten politician getting money for each person jabbed said so
1/1/1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
0/-1	But now the left can’t wait to have their vaccines. I still remember when kommila was adamant about not taking it because it’s “trumps vaccine”.
0/0	But now they have the gull to tell us we need to take a vaccine for a low-threat virus? I can't believe people are actually defending this shit.
0/0	But now they want folks to get a new toxic jab ever 8 months. No thank you.
1/1	But scientists remain confident it will protect against serious disease.' And that's exactly who we should be listening to to. Not the small study as stated above.
1/1	But someone who struggled to pass high school science said on fb that the vaccine isn't safe hit me up with it when it's my turn.
0/0	But studies are showing the boosters don’t work against the variants…..
0/-1	But that woman with bleach poisoning was doing what the government told her to do. Just like the vaccine. Being an NPC is dangerous, isn't it?
1/1	But that's what thousands of people are doing for us right now to try and find you a vaccine without side affects that works.
1/1	But the anti-vaxxers say 'insert made up figure here' have died through vaccinations
0/0/0	But the covid vaccine side effects are NOT mild to moderate; they are EXTREME, AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
0/0	But the covid vaccines appear not to be working. I will stick with my naturally acquired immunity and not risk the blood clots and strokes suffered by people I know just a week after receiving the vaccine. Ha, they refuse to see the connection.
0/0	But the current vaccines are ineffective against the now dominant strain - So what's the point??
0/0	But the drugs companies want a profit and the politicians want a quick fix. So long term testing goes out the window. Caution is thrown to the wind.
1/1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to a bad immune system, can die if not enough people take it. This is not about us as individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
0/0	But the vaccine doesn’t stop you getting Covid
1/1	But the vaccine isn’t becoming “useless”. It’s not a situation where it either works 100% or it doesn’t at all, the vaccine reduces the impact that getting infected has. Letting “nature take its course” is a stupid idea and hopefully you don’t need someone to explain to you why, and if you do, then you’re disgustingly misinformed.
0/0	But the vaccine was sold to the world as the only way to stop the virus. Sold as stopping transmission, won’t be able to catch covid. Sold as a lie. Ideas of any sort of home treatments Jane been suppressed to guide millions to the vaccine. That’s different.
0/0	But the vaccines workkkkkkk you guys ill pass on that experimental jabbbb!!!!!!
0/0	But they are the first mRNA vaccines. Really a coincident? I would expect some mRNA vaccines for other preventable diseases before this one.
1/1	But they died free!!! Or something like that.
0/-1	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	But they or someone they live with might get sick from a virus or bacteria that they picked up around the time they got vaccinated.
0/0	But they said it was safe !!!!!
0/0	But they said it was safe!
1/0	But to be fair studies have shown vaccines cause autism. Because you need to be alive to get it
1/1	But vaccines aren’t just for yourself. The main reason we get vaccines is so we don’t spread it to others who may be as risk to whatever it is you get the vaccine for. The fact that you’re worried about yourself instead shows how self centered you are.
1/1	But vaccines will soon make a big difference to transmission, where billions of doses will be available over the next few months
0/0	But wait I thought this vaccine was the miracle cure hense the reason your making millions of people be your test dummies for it…
0/0	But wait, Joe said he had a plan..no nevermind, he doesn't..but wait, the vaccine is the answer, nope, wrong again...masks work, ummm, well, questionable at best....oh I know, lockdowns, surely THAT will do the trick, well sh!t, wrong again! So are the days of our lives....😂🤷🤦
0/0	But we are getting news such as that the person who had his two doses of vaccine and died of covid...how is it possible? What u r saying is true
1/1	But we can't even get appointments for elderly in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. We are still in phase 1 a because there aren't enough vaccines here. Please step in and help Pennsylvania.
0/0	But what about the "breakthrough" covid infections?... over half hospitalized are fully vaccinated.
0/0	But what about the long-term effects? We don't know what could happen in the future
0/-1	But what happens to your immortal soul when you take this genetically induced vaccine?
1/1	But what’s funny is they’ll claim the 0.1%-2% (whatever they choose) death rate from COVID is small enough to warrant risking getting the disease, but this astronomically smaller chance of simply getting a mild side effect from the vaccine is enough to throw them in a panic.
0/-1	But when provided with a map and specific instructions on where to get it, 28% of the students got inoculations.
1/1	But where is the vaccine? About 90 percent people still not vaccinated!!
1/1	But yeah… go off about how vaccines and masks are just as bad. I know math is hard for the ignorant so let me tell you that is 5"
0/0	But you are NOT protecting anyone. You are only putting money into the hands of big Pharma and putting yourself in harms way…
1/1	But you are not talking about the real issue about these vaccines, their availability for every single human being on the planet, currently these vaccines are not even accessible to half of the global population on Earth because, they are very expensive to afford, it sucks...
0/0	But you cannot sue for damages. That should tell you everything.
0/0	But you can’t say it’s better than getting Covid when a third have no symptoms and the vast majority of the rest have mild symptoms - I’ve had Covid twice now and only had a mild cough. I won’t be having the vaccine. I’m not anti vax but i am pro safety-too many unknowns for me
0/-1	But, but it’s safe!
1/1	But.....once everyone who wants one has access to it, who cares? Let the skeptics and the paranoid anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists learn the hard way.
1/0	But..that is the science of ALL vaccines. They aren't 100% fool proof for everyone. Everyone is different. They largely work.. but some will experience issues. Same with measles, and everything else before it.
1/1	Buuuut... yes, it's 85%+ effective against ALL of the new strains... so get vaccinated!
0/0/0	By CDC's own numbers recovery rates are higher than the vaccine effectiveness. ...I'll pass
1	By February end all 'interested' healthcare workers would have taken shot. Rest will do so as & when they wish in future. Govt. has done its part of vaccinating them on priority. Time now to shift focus on other frontline workers.
1/1/1/1	By God I never thought I'd see the day
1/1	By God’s grace, I got the CoviShield-AstraZeneca vaccine today. It’s a relief since I’ll be living again with my 94-year-old grandma in 2 weeks.
0/1	By all means feel free not to have the vaccine but at least have the decency to accept the science and statistics...Oh yes, and also accept the fact I think you are a moron for not having it because you are! ;)
1/1	By all means, do your research and come to your own conclusions. But if you reach the conclusion that vaccines are bad for you and should be avoided, you probably fucked that up.
0/0	By declining the vaxx , I am 100% safe from any adverse effects , and also have a 99% survival rate without needing the jabs I have faith in my immune system
0	By definition it is not even a "vaccine". Approved vaccines sterilize the virus or at the very least build proper antibodies. This is an "emergency use authorization" gene therapy which does nothing except worsen your immune system. Worst human experiment known to mankind!!
0/0	By denying that the c19 vaccine is poison, Trump has sealed his future.He'll never again be President.
0/1	By early August, there were 87 cases of TTS in Australia from 6.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Five of those people died.
1/1	By getting vaccinated, we are showing our care and concern for our community.
1	By getting vaccinated, you are contributing to public health efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of your community.
1/1	By getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, you're also protecting the most vulnerable members of our society
0/1	By no means all vaccination skeptics are enemies of the constitution.
0/0	By no means am I an #antivac person. BUT, let the record reflect that there's no way I'll get an untested, unproven #CovidVaccine aka #TrumpVaccine within the first 2 years. I'd rather #StayAtHome and #StaySafe. This disaster will ONLY get worse.
1/1	By not getting the vaccine you put other people, including your loved ones, at risk. This is as reckless as drunk driving.
0/1	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid!
0/0/0/0/0/0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.

0/0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid😂
0/0/0	By pausing the vaccine, they are telling us the vaccine may be more harmful than the virus (according to Emergency Use Authorization guidelines). Either the J&J vaccine is worse than they tell us or the virus is not nearly as bad as they tell us.
0/0	By rasing your vibrational frequency with the emotion of love, the immune system will be golden.
1/1	By rejecting a vaccine, Trump voters are naturally selecting themselves out of the gene pool. Thanks be to them
0/1	By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
1/1	By spring, Covid will have killed almost one of every three hundred Americans and people still don’t see the need to get vaccinated. A death wish.
0/0	By taking care of yourself, your immune system will do the good job it's suppose to do, not being a lab rat, for big pharma.
0/0	By taking that vaccine you still won't be protected! You don't even know the risk!
1/1	By taking the Covid vaccine you take a proactive step to protect yourself and others from the virus
0/0	By taking the vaccination your still not protected!you don't even know the risk
1/1	By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
0/1	By the time I'll be getting my corona vaccine y'all be moved onto other things thinking the pandemic is over everywhere. "I'm vaccinated" will be met with "against what?" I'm sure of it.
0/0	By the time they rolled out the shots, I was dead set on doing the opposite of everything the government was trying to force me to do over covid
1/-1	By the way scientists/doctors changing their minds are a good thing. We all make decisions based on information available at the time. But things change rapidly in this pandemic, and new evidence are presented all the time. So doctors updating their stance and views are absolutely a good thing (and essential) when dealing with this pandemic.
0/0	By the way the 5.66m is the correlative figure. We didn't have excess deaths till the roll out of the vaccine. What is causing that if it's not Covid?
0/0	By the way, childhood vaccination is going to be a huge issue now. The lies about the Covid vaccine stopping transmission have called all vaccines into question. If you’re pro-childhood vaccination, you should be enraged at Pfizer / CDC. No credibly anymore.
0/-1	By you weaponized by you!!!
0/-1	By your own explanation, since I've already had the virus the mRNA has already done it's thing, therefore the vaccination will do nothing for me that my body hasn't already done. Yes?
1/1	Byeeeeee COVID
0/0	C'mon man! Now...here's the deal... The doc died from the vaccine. CASE CLOSED!
1/1	CAN WE LET THOSE WHO ARE NOT VACCINATED AGAINST COVID19 AND WHO GOT THE DISEASE BE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL TO COPE ALONE AND DIE ON THE STREETS CUZ THEY SHOULD GO TO DIE.

1/1	COVID 19 vaccination? Completed it mate! I was very impressed with the organisation and professionalism of all staff and volunteers at the @mpftnhs vaccine centre in Stafford. Was put at ease and felt safe throughout. Thank you.
1/1	COVID 19 vaccines have proven to be effective but COVID 19 infection associated with other co-morbidities such as HIV, TB and Hypertension has been more severe. Do well and get vaccinated today, you owe yourself a COVID 19 free life.

1/1	COVID death is almost entirely avoidable for most people with a vax. The ones who won't vax are very tied to their egos and fears and cannot think beyond themselves and their defiance.
1/1	COVID feels like a bad flu, I am vaxxed and boosted which I am grateful for. It's nothing you want ever. Taking naps, reading, watching TV. Keep safe everyone.
1/1	COVID has surpassed the flu and pneumonia as a leading cause of death for kids, following shortly after homicides and heart disease. The study found that COVID may be also the leading vaccine-preventable disease. <90% of kids in the US under 5 are unvaccinated.
1/1	COVID hurts us all, but it hurts the unvaccinated the most. It's literally because their body has no clue how to fight the virus. Thus, why vaccines exist.
0/0	COVID in general is just so exaggerated to create fear. My co-worker who I worked with directly and the asshole I used to live with both got COVID. Never tested positive, never got sick. Also companies forcing people to get vaccinated is dumb.
