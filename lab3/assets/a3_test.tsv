1	"I did my own research" means you looked online at what you already believed in, and then the algorithm kept feeding you your own opinion, making you believe you are right. Instead of believing the actual scientific research or doctors who actually studied this. Also the "I knew someone who had a bad reaction" is not a reason. Not if you simply ignore the millions of people who had no bad reaction.
1	"I don't know what's in it." As if they know what's in the hamburgers they eat, the milk they drink, the high fructose corn syrup they consume... what a tragedy of stupidity.
1	"In the September time frame, unvaccinated people in their 40s were 55 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared with fully vaccinated people of the same age." ~Texas Department of State Health Services, 11/15/21 --- This calculates to over 98% of COVID deaths occurring among unvaccinated Texans.
0	"It is a pity" that people are dying from the vaccine that would otherwise be healthy. These are not the same people that would have died from the virus, mind you. These people would have lived long healthy lives.
0	"No long-term safety data? No problem!" - Every media outlet (not suspicious at all)
0	"The protein Spike is in itself harmless" they must be joking!
0	"We take other risks so taking this one shouldnt be a problem" is the dumbest argument there is...
0	"anti-vaccer" is a weaponized term so these pharmaceutical companies can get their way. You have to come up with a counter term like "drug pusher"
0	"if you don't have the vaccine, you're robbing someone else their right to live a healthy normal life" lmfao My I.Q just dropped 10 points listening to that Bullshit !
0	#Poison
1	#VaccinesWork
0	1 death from a vaccine is too many.
0	1 month after two of my uncles and my dad got the vaccine, my one uncle died of a heart attack in his sleep, the other had a heart attack, and my dad developed AFIB and congestive heart failure. I have yet to take one because of this.
0	1 more good reason to homeschool! My body! My choice!
0	10 months later and seeing what this thing actually is and what it is meant to do and what it doesn't do and what it is doing. NO ONE SHOULD BE TAKING IT!
0	100 percent the reason im not getting it is because i dont trust the government
1	100% against hospitalization and death. They should of said this from go.
0	100% safe from that if you don't take the jab
0	11 months on and still no symptoms. I feel great. No vaccine and have been visiting my 91 year old nan who smokes ALOT and she's fine. This is about depopulation a Eugenics program.
1	13 billion doses. Millions of lives saved. Thank you science.
1	13k idiots. Natural selection. Let the people who wanna be safe. Don’t take it. More for the smarter people.
0	2 years ago today I took a vaccine that I was led to believe would stop me catching covid, protect me from dying from covid as an asthmatic and someone with congenital heart disease, protect the little people I looked after in my classroom, stop me killing my nan. IT WAS BULLSHIT
0	2 years in still unvaccinated and proud
1	4 shots and hoping for more ...................... still going strong
1	6 cases out of over 6 million doses administered. Is that even statistically significant?
0	6 people died due to the pfizer vaccine. Why are we still giving it???
1	90% is hugely effective! They're not done with Phase 3 trials, but this is very promising. I'm overjoyed. Thank you, scientists!
0	90% with no idea of immunity or transmission? I'll take the 99 % survival rate w/natural immunity without inserting man-made materials into my body at cell Level.
0	95% effective for a virus that kills at 0.5%.
0	99.6% of ACTIVE cases have mild or no symptoms. WHY would you get a vaccine for THAT?!?!
0	A 94.5% effective, brand new vaccine with unknown long-term effects versus risking getting a virus that has a 99.96% survival rate and then building up natural immunity anyway. I’ll take my chances.
1	A big thanks to Germany! Biontech FTW! :-)
1	A dear person to me in a high risk group was really scared from all the buzz about how dangerous the vaccines are, but they went and took it and I'm super proud of them.
0	A famous comedian in Malaysia died of heart attack few days after booster, a soccer player, a cleaner, a random man, died suddenly after the booster. Many others are getting chest pain, high fever, rashes and many other not so mild side effects. Safety??
0	A few prominent scientists are saying mRNA vaccines have the potential to make women infertile. Does Dr. Croddy have any comment on this?
1	A good friend is recovering after covid, having refused vaccination. He is confused and has trouble focusing. He remembers that he wasn't that way before. A solid hit with covid leaves patients with an average of a seven IQ point drop. He isn't an average victim. He's young and healthy and he's going to live with this damage for decades.
1	A lot of you are alive because your parents made sure that you were vaccinated against the diseases that were killing children in the 40&50s. So what if you had a sore arm you are on the right side of the grass to complain about it. I am 81, have had my second shot no problems.
0	A man in my apartment building just died about a week ago of a brain bleed. He got the Covid shot. This shot is a killer.
0	A moment of silence for the school children who will be forced to get the vaccine in school
0	A month after the vaccine I miscarried. Not so sure anymore and other woman complaining about heavier periods even lasting WEEKS…
1	A vaccine created in a year is an amazing achievement for science and humanity . I feel proud to live in these times.
0	A vaccine that nobody is held accountable if I develop a reaction or die? Yeah, no thanks.
0	A weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
1	A wild antivaxx kid appeared! What would you do? Me: Cough Its super effective!
1	AND we were all blessed to be able to have access to those vaccines which prolonged lives or enhanced them!
0	AVOID these VERY DANGEROUS Covid-19 VACCINES!!!!
0	About 4 months ago, I had COVID-19. I just got my first vaccine and I became very ill with fever, chills, body aches and dizzy spells. Now I’m afraid to get the second dose. Any suggestions?
1	About a year ago, my wife's unvaxxed friend gave us COVID. Both my wife and I were vaccinated. We were sick with flu like symptoms for about a week, but after a lot of rest and fluids we were fine. On the other hand, her friend ended up in the hospital and was put on oxygen. It was like a small scale scientific experiment playing out in our own lives.
0	Absolutely disgusting. This is why I don't go to the doctors as a healthy person. Drug dealers don't come near me.
0	Absolutely no way will I have this vaccine
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
1	After I recommended a patient get vaccinated with the bivalent booster, he sent me a message that he had gotten the shot but was concerned because the pharmacist told him the shot could give him cancer. That pharmacist needs a different job.
0	After every COVID-19 vaccine dose my eczema got worse, after the 3rd dose, I went to a dermatologist who prescribed methotrexate - an anti-cancer drug, I now pay $1,164 every month for dupixent, a drug I didn't need prior to getting a vaccine, my life has been stripped from me
0	After my second Pfizer shot I had. 105.2 fever and convulsions… then pneumonia for 2 weeks… the doctors wanted me to keep my mouth shut and not blame the shot I received
1	All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19
1	All I can say is wow!!
1	All countries, rich and poor, are deeply affected by the virus, and that the vaccination or vaccine distribution should be for all, not for the few.
0	All of this info comes from press releases. In other words, assume that it is all lies.
1	All who doesn’t take the vaccine want Corona to keep harvesting lives and wreak Havoc upon the world
0	All you have to do is build your immune system zinc vitamin D three vitamin C find a good holistic doctor and talk to them you don't need the vaccine
0	Alright I don’t think watching this video is gonna make me less scared to get the vaccine
0	Alright, so now look into the covid protein spike and it's prion capable modification. Make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into when you take those shots, and it will also shed some light on the side effects you may have seen.
1	Also sitting here watching some videos on COVID-19 vaccine symptoms and how it all works. It's fascinating, and the human body is just incredible! After the first shot 3 weeks ago of Pfizer, all I felt was a sore arm and the next day completed a 21km Spartan BEAST race with no adverse effects (Yes, it was silly to do but I couldn't change the dates and wanted to compete), and now I'm here after the second dose yesterday morning, with very mild symptoms. My arms hurts at the injection site but only if I lift my arm and touch the area, and other than that I have a slight headache, my muscles and joints are only very slightly sore, and so far that's it!
0	Am vaccine free and glad i didnt comply. Feel bad for those who did.
1	Amazing news! I just hope that people will think about the bigger picture here. Yes covid has a 99% survival rate but I encourage everyone to have this vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society not just themselves!
1	An infected teacher standing up projecting their voice (virus) can infect a whole class of students in a lesson and in turn their families. That is why it is vital to vaccinate all teachers before ending remote learning.
1	And a vaccine literally introduces the virus to your immune system in a non harmful way... Good food doesn't produce antibodies, a vaccine does.
0	And the companies that produce these vaccines are immune from prosecution should it all go wrong. Funny that, they're obviously concerned about how this vaccine is going to affect some people.
0	And we still keep listening and doing what we're told!! Our bodies are intoxicated by poison and so are our minds! Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr John Campbell, you are saving souls!
1	And you’re more likely to be hit by lightning than get a blood clot from a vaccine (odds are less than one in a million)
0	Another vaccine propaganda article!
1	Anti Vaxxer logic: My kid can’t get autism, if they die from polio
1	Anti vaxxers will ignore all of the facts. This is proof that the covid vaccines are safe. They've all had human trials.
1	Anti-vaxers chose to believe the lie because the lie is always more interesting than the truth
1	Antibodies were detected after the vaccine
1	Antivaxxers seem to have left the contents of their heads at home.
1	Antivaxxers: "Give me liberty or give me death!" Covid: "No problem, heres both."
0	Any group that drags its feet on cancer treatments but pushes through the covid vax can’t be trusted.
0	Any side effects doctor. None at all just death. But if you get covid you may die. Just vaccinate me to make sure I die than.
1	Any vaccine is a better chance of NOT having clots than not getting it at all. Bring back the J&J. I’d rather suffer once and take the risk
0	Anybody ever hear of a “vaccine” you need to take four times in a year and it doesn’t stop the spread of the disease? Me neither.
0	Anybody stupid enough to take this vaccine...
0	Anyone else noticed the huge rise in gout after a booster? .. Are they linking that together yet?
0	Anyone who attempts to inject me against my will shall be considered an imminent threat. I am prepared to defend myself by any means necessary.
0	Anyone who gets offended and defensive when asked about their product, it's because they have a hidden agenda.
0	Anything that would have aborted foetal tissue in it I’m not putting in my body.
1	Are vaccines good. Yes. End of discussion. Now stfu besties.
0	Are we going to have boosters as often as smartphone updates? I'm amazed they still call it "vaccines"!
0	Aren’t these vaccines still very experimental?
0	As US citizens we want our vaccines to go to another country
1	As a biochemist in training I can't stress enough how incredible this mechanism is: logical, simple yet incredibly effective and beautiful.
1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines. Everyone should watch and consider getting vaccinated! We deserve our livelihood back.
0	As a healthcare worker, I am NOT taking the vaccine at all. As an Army veteran, I do not trust it.
0	As a man with no vax side effects I have a message to the vaxed and unvaxed I have not social distanced, I have never worn a mask, I have never taken the vax and I jave never been sick or had any side effects. Everyone I know that complied has been sick multiple times and has had side effects that are awful from spots on their livers and brains to much worse.
0	As a nurse, I witnessed my coworkers have significant adverse effects and then be met with stone silence by the medical establishment. That was enough to make me not want to take it.
1	As a participant, who definitely got the vaccine, that's awesome news. Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
0	As a scientist, I made the decision not to get vaccinated based on my review of the original mRNA animal studies. Why did you refrain from getting vaccinated?
1	As a wise man once said, "Taking COVID-19 vaccination is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. There are possibilities that can give you some amount of dangers if you wear a seatbelt, but there are also a MUCH more amount of dangers or possibly death if you don't wear a seatbelt. Either way, no one is correct since they technically have their separate amount of dangers, but wearing a seatbelt is usually much safer than not wearing a seatbelt." And I really do agree with him. That's all :)
0	As an older healthy fit person that works out hard, takes care of their health and hasn't been sick in 7 years I don't need it! MY BODY MY CHOICE!
0	As an unvaccinated person, there's a 99.99% probability I'm safe from COVID. BUT! For an additional risk, I can be 99.991% safe!
1	As bad as this pamdemic was I honestly think it may have advanced medicine by 10 years then where it otherwise would have been
1	As someone from a third world country, I'm envious that US even have the privilege to have so many unfilled appointments. Meanwhile, countries like us here in Southeast Asia are getting desperate to get more supply for vaccines because so many people are in need of it yet are finding it difficult to get vaccinated because of lack of supply. Then countries like the US still have so many people not going to their appointments...
1	As someone who was born autistic I get really offended by the fact Karen’s would rather have their children die then have autism.
1	As soon as it's my turn, yes. I think it's irresponsible to not get it.
0	As soon as it’s proven safe with longer-term trials, I’d be perfectly happy to take it, but with the long-term side effects being so unknown, I’d be very nervous to.
0	As soon as they rolled out the vaccine, I noticed people crashing into telephone poles for no apparent reason. Single car accidents. I also had friends who blacked out within two weeks of getting the jab, so, I put one and one together and realized people are blacking out behind the wheel from recent jabs
0	As the parent of a vaccine-injured child, I have personal experience with what can happen. We've dealt with the repercussions for 15 years. So any possible vaccine side effects, injuries, or deaths should be very carefully studied, including blood work-up, before nonchalantly dismissing causal claims as "absurd" or "conspiracy theories".
1	AstraZeneca 2 weeks ago, I feel healthy, hoping after my next jab I feel the same.
1	At the beginning of the pandemic, when people were clueless about social distance and I was trying to respect it, I was angry. A little later when masks were encouraged, then mandated and I was wearing them while others weren’t, I was angry. When vaccines became available, I got vaccinated as soon as I could and others refused, playing politics or believing into misinformation, I was angry. Now that we’re in the midst of another surge, when COVID-19 is now endemic and we’re just stuck with it because we live in idiocracy, I’m not angry. I’m just tired.
1	Awesome news! The vaccines are going to end this pandemic soon.
1	Ay finally I can prove to my mom why vaccines are important
1	Back in my day, we didn't have vaccines. We just died.
0	Based on the CDC's own numbers, the areas with the highest vaccination rate were the areas with the biggest spike in excess death
1	Be aware of the important role of vaccination, it can save your life
0	Be interesting to see how they can still promote vaccines that aren’t FDA approved without the emergency use authorization…
0	Before the vaccines I did not know anyone with covid. After the vaccines everyone seemed to have it. I saw a connection and still do. Never known so many sick people about since these vaccines.
1	Being born to an anti vaccine mom is like being spawn killed
1	Being concerned of the risks of the vaccine is acceptable but dismissing all evidence of past vaccines being effective is pure ignorance and stupidity.
1	Believe in vaccines
0	Best decision of our lives not taking that garbage
1	Best explanation I have seen so far on vaccines. My goodness. This should be shown everywhere.
0	Best part of not taking the shot is im %100 safe from side effects and i still have a %99 chance of survival if i get it......... Ppl that got the shot cant say the same
1	Best thing you can do for yourself is get the one that’s available to you at the earliest and don’t wait. that’s gonna do worlds better than trying to compare them or waiting.
1	Best vaccine is the one that’s available to you first
0	Better develop medication to give to people who need it in case of Covid instead of poisoning healthy folks.
0	Big NO TO VACCINES ! We need Healthy lifestyle only .
0	Big Pharma is a bigger threat than the covid virus!
1	Biontech and curevac basicly startet the mrna thing and, after they cured covid, they could also find a cure for cancer with this technology. Very promising.
1	Block the boneheads. Have had all the vaccines. Had Covid last month. Barely sick. Hardest part was quarantining over the holidays. Thanks to the vaxs and free Covid tests to monitor my safety around others.
0	Blood clots, nervous system attacks, stroke, bells palsy just to name a few. My vax sibling got the clots and palsy...it's been 6 months and she's still suffering. My elderly father also got bells palsy from the vx...going on 8 months for him.
0	Blood clots, uncontrollable shakes and death but keep wearing a mask ... oh and the vaccines are absolutely safe .... bs!
1	Boohoo, I got the covid vaccine and am fine
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!
1	Booster shots are extremely effective at protecting against serious illness and hospitalization from COVID. Vaccines work!
1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
1	Both of my grandparents got theirs and no reported issues. My grandma got hers about a month ago now and only said there was a little pain in her arm but they is 100% normal. The rest of my family is getting it Monday :)
1	Breaks my heart watching this now. I have multiple immunocompromised friends and family. March 2020, my best friend, who got a BS in biomedical engineering, went home to her extremely conservative, small church, homeschooled family. A few months later, she was unmasked, unvaccinated, at large gatherings, after traveling outside of the country. I called her on it, and encouraged her to get it not for her, but for her younger siblings. She accused me of saying she didn't care about her family. That was the last time we talked. After four years of being inseparable, my friend group fell apart out of fears for our own health and safety and those for our families.
1	Bring it on so we can live again
0	Bro. The vaccine side effects are the virus symptoms? Whats goin on there?
0	But my opinion. ...vaccine against covid19 is not safe
0	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already. Something is not right
0	By not taking the vax. I prolonged my life by 50 years
1	CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate. CHOOSE LIFE. Vaccinate.
1	COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection
1	COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic
1	COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting COVID-19
0	Call tonight from best friend who's relative (age 54) was found dead on the porch this morning after walking the dogs. He had his first Covid vaccine shot yesterday. He had long term MS but received a healthy report from the Dr. last week. Everyone in shock.
1	Can help to improve immunity
0	Can someone explain to me why risking getting the vaccine would be better than just getting covid, or maybe even getting neither considering the covid risks are minimal anyway? I'm also under 30 and decently healthy.
0	Can we stop calling them "breakthrough cases" when they already said the shot doesn't keep you from getting it
0	Can you explain the sudden increase in heart attacks in former athletes who are under 50 years of age? And the discovery of Sudden adult deaths syndrome?
1	Can't wait for my parents to get vaccinated.
1	Can't wait for the day when the covid 19 vaccine is widely available to everyone.
0	Canadian here. Always say no to 1984. The idea that the unvaccinated are a risk to anyone other than themselves is moronic.
1	Can’t wait until my son can get it.
1	China vaccines good
1	Co-worker was hung up on vaccine side-effects even though her doctors and some co-workers (me included) said it was nothing and Covid itself is worse. ICU for her.
0	Considering the vaccine killed my Grandpa. NO!
1	Cooking at home or taking a bath is more dangerous than having the vaccine. Less than 1 in a million side effects!
0	Could you tell us what’s in the vaccines? If people knew I don’t believe they would take them....and no one needs a vaccine for a virus with a 99.9 survival rate
0	Covid is a strange pandemic, heavily vaccinated countries have more excess deaths, post the rollout of the vaccine, than they did during the pandemic without the vaccine. Go figure.
1	Covid is serious and death is not its only serious outcome! No one should get Covid deliberately!! Our safest way out of this are the vaccines so go get vaccinated people!!
0	Covid vaccine is causing AIDS-like symptoms.
0	Covid was sent by democrats. And the vaccine isn't a cure. It causes strokes and heart attacks. Another hoax.
0	Covid-19 vaccines will protect us 1 week. My wife received her 2nd dose last week, and she was just diagnosed with Covid-19 today.
1	Crazy how some people believe the links their friends post on Facebook more than doctors who have studied medicine for years.
0	Crimes Against Humanity
1	Currently, im taking my time seeing what happens to get my vaccine, i am not anti vax im just genuinely scared of it all and am uncertain. If i have to, in order to work, i will get it, until then i will wait and see what happens. However, i would gladly get a vaccine that doesnt require 3 within a year
1	DJ Khalid!!! I got the shot!! And I got another one!! And another one!!! And another one!!!We the vax's!!
0	DON’T DO IT! Well, it is your choice but don’t tell me to do it!
1	Day 11 on Moderna and I feel fine. Just had sore arm the day after I got it.
1	Day 12 on moderna no side affects so far I feel good
1	Day two with Covid, I feel like I've been hit by a double decker bus. If this is what it's like after three jabs I can only imagine what it would be like for the unvaccinated! Get your vaccines people!
0	Deadly cocktail of chemicals
0	Definitely not taking this poison
1	Did you not read the article. It said vaccine is good
0	Didnt even need the first shot. It has been proven to be ineffective
0	Dies suddenly at 27 after getting the COVID ‘vaccine’.
0	Do another video about how it gives you fatal conditions like myocarditis please. I'm super interested in the topic of the vaccine doing more harm than good and I would like to know why this video is up still because of that :) Seems like you are contributing to people's sickness which could get you into legal trouble I would hope.
0	Do not take the vaccine! It is the mark of the beast! Whoever takes it, God will leave DESOLATE and not forgive!
0	Doctor says: The Patten number for the covid vaccine is 060606. Sheep person: Says nothing strange about that I’ll take it give me three.
0	Doctors said it didn't impact periods. They lied.
0	Don't bring vaccine in our Africa we don't want it
0	Don't get the Vaccine

0	Don't trust the vaccine . My choice .
0	Don't trust these "vaccines".
0	Don’t search for the truth on social media or websites basically. Just obey and get the shot. No thank you
1	Dr. Mike….I’m 57 and I am 100% pro-vax….I am doing it for myself AND I live with my 92 yr old mom at home of which I act as a caregiver for her.
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up.
0	EVERYONE should be refusing to be a guinea pig in this eugenics experiment
0	Each successive shot helps to wreck your immune system.
0	Even if I die, i will never regret NOT getting the shots. because i didnt get them…OUT OF LOVE
0	Even my elderly parents are like “no more vaccines”. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years…
1	Every child has the right to get preventive vaccines!!
0	Every death is significant!!!!! Someone’s family member has died due to this POISON!!!! This is experimental gene therapy!!!!
0	Every drug has side effects
0	Every time I hear a "get your shot" spot on the radio it makes me angry. It's on all the stations. Never once a word about any problems with them.
1	Everybody I talk to about this in my area is in the "whatever" camp, which infuriates me. Yeah, whatever if you get it, but what about when you visit your parents/grandparents/coworkers, then they get infected and it spreads further?
1	Everybody, finishing something quickly doesn't mean it is rushed
0	Everyone is seeing how ineffective this vaccine is so now they have to find another excuse to try to force it on us
1	Everyone should do all they can to keep the anti vaccers from getting the shot!! Its a gift to clean the idiots from society
1	Everyone should take the vaccine Even the anti-vaccine people
0	Everyone’s getting sick from all the jabs!!!
0	Evil. No scientific data supporting efficacy...do your own research. Pathogenic Priming is a huge hurdle that mRNA vaccines have struggled with and is a major unknown risk...Do NOT take this vaccine.
1	Exact same side effects as every other vaccine, people are just always scared of the unknown.
1	Excellent video explains the myth that blanketed many who are against or doubt of getting the vaccination.
0	Expect cancer , infertility and other illnesses to sky rocket , now , in the short term and long term ,
0	Explain why you get a sore throat from the vaccine and all the symptoms of having the virus. That can only happen if it is invading cells!
1	FUCK YEAH!!! My family and I were able to get our first doses yesterday! Happy to be part of this statistic!!!
1	Failing to vaccinate your kids is akin to child abuse.
1	Flu vaccines regularly have 40-60% efficacy, considered to be good. Anything that is 60% - 90% efficacy is 'simply the best'
1	For anyone wondering, the vaccines are perfectly safe. I got mine today and didn’t immediately die. My mom also got her’s a week before mine and she’s fine
0	For someone not obese, sick or elderly the jab is medically unnecessary and a greater risk than the lab-engineered and patented bug.
0	For this vaccine human are the rats,
1	For those on the fence, it’s time to protect yourself and others; please get vaccinated.
0	Forcing healthy people to take medicine they don't need is a crime.
1	Fortunately, a vaccine for Covid-19 has also been produced. That means all activities will be returned to its orbit and happy life lies ahead.
0	Four days after having my first vaccination, I was rushed to hospital with an aneurism bleed.... Maybe Just a coincidence, but I wouldn’t be having a second jab
0	Freedom is worth dying for. My body my choice!
1	Fuck that. I’ll get a shot a week if it keeps me from getting that wretched virus.
0	Fuck the Vaccine
0	Fully test them first and let all of the pharmaceutical companies do what's in the best interest of the public. Not about the profit.
1	Fully vaccinated and feel great
1	Fully vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!!!
1	Fully vaxxed as of last week since i quit my old job and joined a hospital in late Feb. GF just got her first shot too through our vaccine-share program that is constantly filled up. For the first time in a longtime I've started to feel hopeful.
1	Fully vaxxed as of today! Such a relief.
1	Fully vaxxed no regrets
0	Fun fact: Im unvaccinated and healthy.
0	Funny how so many of these people did put their lives on the line just to prove how safe the vaccine was until they literally gave their lives for a useless no good poison that’s destroyed so many lives. I couldn’t put my life on theline for something I’mnot sure of
0	Funny how they say they still don’t know everything about the virus yet they claim to know everything about the safety of the vaccines.
1	Funny that all those people that are scared of the vaccine, drive their car, cooking, take medicine every day.. Each of these have higher odds of dying than the 1 in 10 million of the vaccine (Astra only)
1	Get any vaccine you can at the first opportunity you can. The benefits outweigh any side effects
1	Get the vaccine if you can!
1	Get vaccinated it might save your life
1	Get vaccinated!
1	Get vaccinated! The life you save might be your own.
1	Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1	Getting mine in a week and I'm so stoked
1	Getting my first dose in a few hours, I'm glad this pandemic will be over soon
1	Getting my first shot in about ten minutes
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped out my mind at ease a bit.
1	Getting my first vaccine tomorrow. This helped put my mind at ease a bit.
1	Getting my second Pfizer shot next week. Cant wait!
1	Getting my second shot of Pfizer on April 14th! Only side effect was soreness in my arm. Off to visit my parents in May who have also both been vaccinated. Amazing job Pfizer and BioNTech! Hope they start implementing vaccine passports to keep the people who are afraid of the shot at home.
1	Getting vaccinated is necessary
1	Getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, sanitising your hands etc is not “living in fear”. It’s called “taking due precautions” and it’s the most rational way to live right now.
1	Glad my Wife, Children, and I got the vaccine. My youngest is immunocompromised and has been exposed to covid at school multiple times and even by my brother in law who has no regard for others. None of us have gotten it, that I know of.
1	Glad they can be vaccinated. Wish availability of vaccine vastly improves so all who want a vaccine can get one.
1	Glad to see many people from infants to adults get the benefits of protection from vaccine.
1	Go get your vaccine bro, the time is a minor factor
0	God bless all those who have challenged and refused to comply based on realistic evidence and not media fuelled fear.
0	God created me and I will not inject poison into his creation...never ever
0	God’s intelligence is far superior. Our body is a self healer with right diet and environment. Our body is our doctor. Vaccines is designed to depopulate the world. Herbs are created for us to treat our illness by that supreme being. Please try to understand that we are being controlled. It’s all business. Money making.
1	Going for my second dose of pfizer in a few days. No side effects so far.
0	Good for you. I don't want the vaccine. So leave me alone.
0	Good luck to all of you who took any of these-vaccines- however I refuse to take any vaccine for this 95 percent exaggerated illness as mainly I feel it is anti-Biblical.
0	Good luck with that!! No to Covid vaccine
0	Good man saving lives because we all know Covid was a hoax and the only thing killing people is the vaccine, and he knows it to.
1	Good news because the pace of vaccination needs to pick up soon. Two million a day in the U.S. should be the floor.
1	Good news!
1	Good work WHO. I had all my COVID-19 vaccines including the booster. No side effects. My little girl want to become President of WHO in the near future.
1	Good. I'm glad a vaccine has been determined to be safe and effective enough to be made available for anyone in the public who chooses to take it. If this helps some people reach a decision to opt to receive the vaccine and thereby ends up saving a few lives, then it is a good thing.
1	Goodness I'm so happy you made this video!! The amount of anti-maskers and anti-vaxers is increasing and its so disappointing! Spreading right info and educating the general public is more important than ever! So thank you for this!
1	Got AZ last week. So far everything is great. Had a sore arm for two days and a brief fever which lasted only 1 hour. I actually feel lucky to have some side effect symptoms as it means the vaccine is training my immune system.
1	Got both of the vaccine doses, first time had a small fever, second time only a sore arm and felt lightheaded. Other than that I'm perfectly fine and suggest everyone to do it.
1	Got first shot of Pfizer on Friday,a bit of headache and muscle discomfort in my arm.That's it so far.
1	Got fully vaccinated today, so I performed my "Civic Duty" as the "New World Order Government" claims it to be.
1	Got mine in maryland usa yesterday. Sore arm and a little fatigue but 1000% worth it.
1	Got mine today! So stoked.
1	Got my 2nd dose of moderna Thursday. No side effects!
1	Got my COVID 19 shot yesterday just wanted to learn how vaccines work
1	Got my Oxford AZ vaccine on Friday. Easy. Slight fever for 24 hours and that’s it. Same with my 85 year old granny. I’m 24. Safe for all ages. Go get it! My confidence has grown a lot. We are almost there!!✌🏻
1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine.
1	Got my first Pfizer first dose and feeling good. Can’t wait for the second dose.
1	Got my first Pfizer jab about 22 hours ago. Feeling great, no side effects except for a slightly sore arm. Apparently the second vaccine hits harder though with chills fever and fatigue (which is a normal reaction after getting vaccinated).
1	Got my first dose of Pfizer today. I was not ready for the atmosphere. Everyone was just so UP and excited and happy. It was the most fun I’ve had with strangers in over a year.
1	Got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning! So incredibly happy about it! Experiencing nothing but a sore arm.
1	Got my first dose today (Moderna) my right arm is very sore but nothing I can't handle. Im looking forward to the second dose lets end this nightmare!
1	Got my first dose yesterday, my arm hurts, but I'm glad it's my arm and not my lungs
1	Got my first moderna vaccine today. Health department texted at 1pm went right over to the site and was done by 2 pm. No way was I not going to get this shot.
1	Got my second Pfizer jab yesterday.... feeling ok just some soreness on the arm...please go get vaccinated
1	Got my second dose today, wish me luck! And congrats to everyone who is fully vaccinated
0	Got my second dose yesterday. I never felt more sick in my life. Vomit, chills, running a bad fever, nausea, etc
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine! In fact I feel better than after the first shot where I just had some deltoid tenderness. Now I feel normal!
1	Got my shot thanks to Wisconsin's Save the Fatties program.
1	Got the Pfizer a month ago. Second dose makes you feel weak, but it's all worth it. I'm vaccinated
1	Got vaccinated today, feeling good :)
1	Got vaccinated with sinovac from China last week. So far no side effects. I even went to the gym 3 hours after i got vaccinated
0	Government: don’t worry it’s your choice to get the vaccine! Also government: we will limit your rights and restrict your freedoms because you didn’t get the vaccine your now second class citizens.
1	Grateful for all my Covid vaccines and flu vaccine.... Trying my best to stay well...
1	Great job! Thanks for this video, very useful and help people to understand the vaccine clearly! Go and get vaccinated !
1	Great news. Fantastic work by those involved in creating this vaccine, so thankful to them.
1	Great! Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0	Guess who’s not taking it??? ME!!!!
1	Had Covid-19. Got two vaccines and booster. I’m very grateful to research scientists, doctors and the dedicated medical world.
1	Had my first AZ shot 5 days ago and so far it has been a non event....not even a sore arm....
1	Had my second dose a week ago. I'm so relieved to have gotten it, as I see the death toll and permanent injuries rising due to this disease. Wear your mask, wash your hands, social distance, and get vaccinated! That is how we will defeat COVID.
1	Had my second dose the other day. Felt rough the day after (tiredness, etc) but not as bad as a flu jab!
1	Had the vaccine yesterday feel great nothing but a sore and swollen arm
0	Hannah Fry neglects to mention that science and mathematics can be manipulated by large pharmaceutical companies and politicians to produce false outcomes. I started getting migraines and headaches after my vaccine but foolishly poo pooed the symptoms and had a second jab. After the 2nd vaccine the symptoms intensified resulting in myself having a stroke. I have the brain fog, which seems to be common amongst those affected. I also have headaches, muscle aching and weakness. My job as a fabricator welder may be in jeopardy as I struggle to understand basic technical drawings now. My attention span has diminished as I tire quickly. This reply would normally have taken me 2 minutes to draft . . . 45 minutes now. One more point to Hannah regarding knowing what caused my stroke, I have been super fit all my life and know my body and I can say with 100% certainty that the vaccine caused it, so don't try to defend the drug companies and government above this ladies instinct.
0	Has this vaccine undertaken rigorous testing with a large sample group?
1	Have already been vaccinated “ and I hope covid-19 stay away forever
0	He isn't concerned. Tell that to the family of those who died from the shot. My daughters customer said her mother ended up in ICU after the 2nd shot.
0	He said "it looks safe" ok you've convinced me. You take it and ill see how you are in 5 years.
0	He wouldn’t tell us anyway. Two friends of mine died 2 weeks after getting the Pfizer vaccine. Why are the censoring immunologists and the developer who use to work with Fauci. This guy needs to be investigated.
0	Hell no I will not take it
0	Hell no... no vaccine
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	Hey cinco de mayo for my second shot too! High five! But I'm not going out to celebrate right away, I'm planning to take a week off for memorial day week and travel somewhere!
0	Higher risk for young children and the elderly
1	Honestly It’s Perfectly safe
1	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger. People who refuse the vaccine because it is “too new” and “dangerous” are 1) wrong because the newest vaccines are similar to old vaccines proven to work, just specific to covid strains, and 2) selfish for putting their own standards above the livelihood and health of others.
1	Hope he got the vaccine. Either way thank you to him for furthering science!
0	Hopefully more and more people will refuse the jab and scupper their plans to alter humanity and derail their evil agenda.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don’t have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell’s Palsy ☺️
0	How about we start with bels palsy or violent seizures. Or my favorite death. Take this vaccine at your own risk!!!
0	How can an employer force their employees to take a vaccine that’s not even an FDA approved?
0	How can this lot still push the vaccines with a smile on their face.
0	How do we know the shot is working? Survival rate goes from 99.6% to 99.8%?
1	How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead.
0	How is it possible that nowadays, after all the "vaccine" damages and even deaths coming forward, those "scientist" still claim the so-called "vaccines" are safe and effective. Unbelievable!
0	How long can this take to be verified as safe? 94.6% isn’t safe to me.
0	How will they control us without a pandemic? I feel worried about this already. What will I do left to my own devices? Oh! Get the next booster!
1	Huge news to get vaccine to the masses. We’re going to have a great summer America! Hope you’ve been working on that beach bod during quarantine
1	I JUST WANT TO END THIS, THE VACCINE IS THE THING THAT I WANT FROM THE START
0	I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY OF THIS IT WAS PRODUCED TO FAST
0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE ! It needs more time to develope
1	I Will Get The Vaccine
1	I almost died in Golden Gate Park with COVID Delta while homeless. The most extreme hallucinations. The worst aches and pains. I couldn't make it to the hospital. Nobody would help me. I had no phone to call for help. I am so lucky that wasn't the end. I was vaxed and boosted. If I hadn't been I would be dead.
1	I already was able to get a 4th injection ( second booster). In Australia, all over 65 , and immunised suppressed are advised to have a 4th, and all over 30 years have an option to do so.
1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes. Which suggests that I am forming an immunity, but just something that I wanted to share since it was pretty noticeable. I also had soreness of the injection site but other than that nothing else.
1	I also work in healthcare, I am proud to be a Caregiver and yes if I can get the vaccine I will. The well being of my Family and my clients are number one.
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.
1	I am 80 and my wife is 77 and we took the Moderna vaccine and had no side effects on either shot.
0	I am NOT getting it at any cost .
1	I am a UCLA retiree and I still can’t even get my first vaccine because I cannot find any appointments
1	I am a doctor in the U.K. I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! All vaccines will have some degree of risk. The most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!
1	I am a firm believer in vaccinations. That being said, I'm in my 30s and each and every of the 4 covid shots I've had so far were quite brutal. Each time I was sicker than I've ever been. Fast forward into end of 2022, I finally caught the real covid (kids brought it home from school). Just as brutal as the shot, maybe a tad worse. I was fine 2 days later. So, I get it that some people don't want to get vaccinated. But I like to think that, had I not had the vaccine and gotten covid earlier in the pandemic, I probably would have not survived. Yay to science! And yes, I get the flu shot every year.
0	I am a healthy 72 years old not vaccinated, and I had a Covid for the first time in early December 2022. First day body aches and very light fever, second day it was gone just was little tiered. Still was doing all my housework without any difficulties. 4 days later, I was back already on a golf course. No vaccines or boosters for me.
0	I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
1	I am extremely happy that I have had 3 shots for COVID-19, a flu shot & a shingles shot. I feel wonderful, no flu, no headaches, no nothing. I agree, Go Get Vaccinated Now.
1	I am from Bangladesh, which is a third world country. Before WHO and the government stepped in, hundreds of kids used to die from preventable diseases like measles, small pox etc. My own cousin died from small pox at age of 2 because she didn't receive the vaccine on time. Hearing people in the 1st world country saying vaccines are harmful makes me really sad and angry at the same time.
1	I am fully vaccinated and was fine second dose just soreness
0	I am healthier with the GOD given immune system HE gave me.. I will take my chances.. No vaccine for me..
0	I am not getting the vaccine. Half the people I talked to had side effects. I am not trading one risk for another. It’s my body.
0	I am not going to become an experimentation subject for the global mRNA testing. Even if they pay me to do it . I can't be sure that it doesn't touch the DNA and also i find it useless.
0	I am not going to get the vaccine
1	I am planning to take one of these vaccines I believe they are going to make a difference I have no intention of wanting to be locked in doors to stay safe. Bring it on
1	I am so appreciative of this video, thank you very much for this much needed information, it is balanced and accurate and fair information, we need more Dr's to speak about the real effectiveness and information regarding the vaccine....there is way too much fear mongering and misleading info on other sites
1	I am so lucky to have been vaccinated and not have to worry so much. There are still so many things to do in life.
0	I am surprised they give you a choice in the military! However, I ain't taking that thing!
0	I am victim of vaccine too and covid infection. Both dont work well on me. My immune system has started to behave crazy.This has been a mess so far. I jave taken so many other vaccines before and never had such reactions. Have been perfectly healthy before. I feel so let down by govt , doctors etc. I have lost trust on people in general now
0	I believe covid-19 was created in a lab by the Chinese government. The vaccine will just make covid-19 mutate exponentially faster to than it already is. Virus always is faster and smarter than any human can possibly imagine.
1	I believe vaccine very much and I'm in UAE here it's compulsory including each 13 day pcr test otherwise we cannot go anywhere except own Room and i love this rule thankful to UAE government
1	I can't believe it has become controversial to say it, especially among "conservatives," but I believe in science. I trust American scientists. I believe in vaccines.
1	I can't believe it has become controversial to say it, especially among "conservatives," but I believe in science. I trust American scientists. I believe in vaccines. #GetVaccinated
0	I can't believe they can give us this info like it's completely fine wow!
1	I can't get over the irony of Texans dying on the hill of "personal freedom" but God forbid a woman decides to have a choice about her reproductive health.
1	I can't wait for my second shot in 4 weeks!
1	I can't wait to get mine. Unfortunately my special Premier and his cabinet members who were all traveling abroad for Xmas (on Dec 13th they put a traveling ban both for cross provinces and international borders) are deemed more important than me and the majority of the population, so I have to wait.
1	I can't wait to get the vaccine! I am at risk and haven't left my home in a year. After I get it I'm going to double-mask and get a hair cut :)
0	I canceled my booster yesterday.
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped and we don’t know if long-term side effects are a thing.
1	I cannot understand why so many people don't wan to get the vaccine, I can understand it in some circumstances, but I believe that that is the underground scenario
1	I cant wait to receive my vaccine.
1	I can’t wait to get mine!
1	I caught covid recently & it was super mild. I thank being vaccinated. I didn't even think I was sick until I took a test. However, my redneck nieces and nephews refuse the vaccine, and it's been brutal for them. No sympathy from me.
1	I did have side effects that included breathing, living, enjoying life, not spreading the virus to others, not getting the virus, and the like.
1	I did not have a "medical professional" advise me to get or not get the vaccination....I read the chart, and since I am over 65, and have some of the health issues, I signed up. No one said anything to me at either of the injection sites about whether I should get the shot or not. People have to use their own judgement and common sense about what to do...."medical professionals" all have different opinions.!!
0	I did not take the shot and when I learned what it was, I am glad I didn't
0	I didn't even get to CHOOSE whether or not I took it. I keep worrying I'm gonna die in my sleep or have a heart attack from your science project in my bloodstream
0	I do not trust anything the government has developed..
0	I don't care about your facts or myths. Its all BS to me. I will never take this ridiculous vaccine! They will never tell you what's really in it! THINK TWICE!!
0	I don't care how many black nurses, celebrities, or tv doctors get the vaccine I'm not taking it.
1	I don't get it; Why do the people who don't trust the doctors, always go running to those same doctors when they get really sick? Why don't they go to the people who told them that the doctors are wrong?
0	I don't know anyone eager to trust a new injection with no long term testing. The scientific community wavered so much on during Covid they didn't exactly inspire confidence in getting something right the first time. I understand that's how science works and that's also why I won't be getting the vaccine
0	I don't need to be told how to evaluate covid vaccine reactions. If someone was fine, gets the vaccine and dies with days or weeks; the vaccine caused it.
0	I don't plan to get this vaccine rushed out too fast!
0	I don't trust a vaccine made THAT fast. COVID-19 is a shitty, scary thing, but I'd rather stay in quarantine than possibly put myself at harm by taking a vaccine that isn't proven to be reliable
0	I don't trust doctors,the medical profession and the vaccine has not been tested long enough.
1	I don't understand why 20 percent of careworkers wont have the vaccine .How can they say they care for their clients if they potentially will bring the infection back .Some are visiting 6 or 7 homes a day .If they dont care enough to have the vaccine they should find another job
0	I don't vaccinate my kids. I believe its harmful to them and could lead to complications.
0	I don’t care what is said, I am not getting the Covid vaccine
0	I don’t care what they try..I’m not getting that vaccine!
1	I don’t feel controlled by government when I wear a mask or get #COVID19Vaccine any more than I do wearing a seatbelt, deciding not to drink & drive or stopping at red light. I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The common good matters.
0	I don’t have to do anything I’m not comfortable doing.
0	I don’t trust taking this vaccine moving on.
1	I don’t trust trump, but I do trust the vaccine. I’m getting it ASAP.
1	I don’t understand why six people in six million (J&J,) is this much of a concern. Seems like the virus is much more dangerous.
1	I don’t understand why there are people on here telling others NOT to get vaccinated! You are part of the problem.
1	I feel bad for the doctors and nurses these people put are risk every single day while they try to save their lives after they've been accused of being liars and part of a conspiracy
0	I feel bad for those who signed up for the experiment and thought they were given the vaccine when actually they're given a placebo
1	I feel better after the injection
1	I feel for all the doctors and nurses at the moment!! If only more people got vaccinated!! It would be less work for them all!!
1	I feel for the hospital staff. I'm fully vaccinated plus the booster and I'm still scared of becoming sick with the cases climbing so fast
1	I feel like I lost brain cells watching these anti vaxxers
1	I feel like listening to any anti-vaxxer is BEYOND frustrating when you are from a third world country, rejecting vaccines comes from their privilege of living in a developed country that we most certainly don't have
1	I feel so relieved that the covid 19 vaccine is here and has been tested for safety and efficacy.
0	I feel sorry for people who get the vaccine, because they have no idea what it does to them :( the vaccine is not for covid19, the agenda is way different.
1	I felt super crummy right after the 2nd dose and then they where gone and as an ICU nurse that has seen the horrors of the pandemic first hand I’ll take it one million times over
1	I get J&J and none symptoms at all👍
1	I get me second tomorrow. I can’t explain the feeling of freedom (2 weeks later, I know, but nice to have it over with).
1	I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
0	I got Jabbed AGAINST MY WILL TO KEEP MY JOB
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good!
1	I got both shots of the vaccine. Only had a sore arm for 24 hours. Feel fine.
1	I got four COVID vaccines the last two-ish years. Most of my friends has got COVID vaccines, none are dead
1	I got mine Fri.Jan29. I get my 2nd one Feb. 29.
1	I got mine I'm doing fine
1	I got mine. I’m a kindergarten teacher. No side effects, no creepy stuff in it. If you are given the opportunity, take it. Try to be as brave and selfless as we are on the front lines in kindergarten.
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday. No side effects unless you count that I get 5G on a 4G phone now and I have a hankering for human flesh.
1	I got my Moderna vaccine and now I'm a Wifi Hotspot
1	I got my Pfizer shot yesterday the only problem was my arm is a little stiff but other than that it’s all good.
1	I got my booster vaccine shot today & that’s me #GetVaccinated
1	I got my pfizer vaccine n only had headace n sleeping...
1	I got my second Pfzer vaccine yesterday We're all making history here :)
1	I got my second dose earlier this month. I feel a-okay. 👍🏻
1	I got my second injection and once again my only side effect was a sore arm for a couple of days. I used an ice pack on it and that helped.
1	I got my vaccine today, got the Johnson and Johnson, it was the least painfully vaccine I have ever got, and I am very excited for my city is open 100%
1	I got the AstraZeneca vaccine today and glad that I did
1	I got the J&J Vaccine, and getting a Moderna booster next week. Hate needles with a passion but it's worth it!
1	I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine 2 months ago and so far I have been filling fine with no problems.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine and I am very pleased that I did.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine months ago, literally no side-effects, I ain't gonna support anybody being forced to get it (by the government anyways, if shops wanna do vaccine passports and businesses wanna force their employees to get it, that's their business) but that won't stop me from thinking people who don't are idiots, barring legitimate medical reasons, like immune suppression or allergies to ingredients
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine. Last one is on April 1. So happy! No side effects!
1	I got the fever and everything. Yet, I would go and take another shot of the vaccine any day. I am eternally grateful to the scientists that spent years and even decades to research all of this. Thank you!
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fine
1	I got the moderna and it was easier than a flu shot. Still glad I watched this video because learning about the en vitro fetal cells being used to develop the J&J vax was really cool. Would definitely like to learn more about how they do that.
1	I got the vaccine already 3 times and I will get it until it’ll be necessary . Same as I did with the other vaccines
1	I got the vaccine and I got covid. I had the vaccine last year. So it's been a year and now I'm 4 days into covid. Sure I got covid but this is probably a different strand and maybe I have less of a struggle because of the vaccine
1	I got the vaccine both doses of Moderna and I’m thriving. Stop putting false fears.
1	I got the vaccine today, I figured getting the vaccine and dealing with a few uncomfortable side effects would be better than getting covid and ending up in hospital.
1	I got vaccinated and I'm glad! Time to get back to life now!
1	I got vaccinated because I am not a delusional domestic terrorist.
1	I got vaccinated last week, Moderna. Zero side effects. Second shot in 2 weeks.
1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects, i hope the second dose will be fine
0	I guess rip to my family and anyone I know required to take these things for their jobs.
1	I had COVID about a month ago. It was super mild for me. But I’m double vaxed and boosted.
1	I had a 102 Fever, chills, body aches, headache, lower back pain for 2 days, etc. but I would do it again. It's better than having covid and NOT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE!!!
0	I had a stroke after getting the shot. My life is ruined... What am I suppose to do now? No attorney will take my case...
1	I had all my shots and never tested positive for covid
1	I had both Moderna vaccines and the Moderna booster. Nothing but great results. I am 75.
1	I had both my vaccines(I'm from the the UK and had AstraZeneca) My first jab was flu symptoms, hot to cold and then shivers for a few hours then I was completely fine. My second was even better since I had a headache... that's it.
1	I had excellent experiences when I got both my shots. Very nice people. Barely felt anything when shots administered. Very professional, kind, prompt, thoughtful.
1	I had hoped when I got vaccinated it would be the beginning of the end for this virus. I was immunized, vaccination rates were going up, it seemed like things would finally return to normal. But it's been allowed to stay extant for so long that it's had time to mutate. Now I'm likely going to have to get multiple booster shots just to stay immune because these fuckers are insistent on letting it run rampant. Delta is just the beginning. It'll mutate again and again as long as antivaxxers deliberately sabotage our herd immunity. They are dragging all of us down for their god damned pride. Say hello to our new yearly flu, everyone.
1	I had mine about two months now I don’t have no side effects thank god
1	I had my 2 shot vaccine covid-19...and it feel great, only arm sore,no big deal,...is a good feeling,my body is protective and I feel confident.....huyyyyy
1	I had my second booster today and, based on the information acquired from your very helpful videos, I asked the vaccinator to aspirate before injecting. I explained why and he was happy to do it. Thanks for all you are doing, keep up the good work.
1	I had my vaccines in the March of 2021 and did my embryo transfer June 2021. I’m now 8 months pregnant. And got my booster shot a few months ago. So far no complications
0	I had never gotten it until my vaccinated son got it and gave it to me
1	I had the Astra first shot and asked the doctor how effective it is, she answered round 95% and also educated me on a couple of other facts so, just ask your doctors anything to do with health, next time lol.
1	I had the Pfizer vaccination yesterday. Apart from a sore arm, absolutely no side effects after 30 hours.
1	I had the vaccine yesterday and literally watched the microchip enter my arm. Now all I see is Bill Gates and Microsoft Windows, but not Windows 10, the shitty Windows Vista operating software. God, if only I'd listened to the Youtube comment experts!! I'm also autistic now.
0	I have a special needs man age 47 yrs of age boarding with me for over 4 years. He had the Covid vaccine and sinch shortly after he has become a very aggressive person that is very strange for me to see as he has always been a placid guy. Nothing has changed in his life that could possibly be the reason for his anger and aggressive behavior. I feel strong in my heart that the covid vaccine is the cause
0	I have an extremely strong allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and I haven’t even had it.
0	I have been so worried about the vaccine. I stopped myself from worrying because I promised myself that I am not getting vaccinated!
0	I have covid right now and I was never vaccinated. Had a fever for the first two days but now I'm fine. My mom got the vaccine and booster (she has covid too) and shes a lot worse than me
1	I have every single vaccine that's ever come out and I'm fine.
1	I have had 3 shots. Scheduled for 4th. Haven't had covid but if I get it I know I won't die.
1	I have had 3 shots. Scheduled for 4th. Haven't had covid but if I get it I know I won't die. LETS GO DARWIN !!!
1	I have had both series of covid Vaccines, I am still alive and well, with no side effects besides my arm is sore from the shot. I'm proud to say I am vaccinated against covid and also the flu.
1	I have had four Covid shots and I feel great.
1	I have had four covid vaccines and not had a reaction to any of them I had major heart surgery five years ago so I think it was a sensible thing too do .Everyone is entitled to their opinion but for me it was the sensible thing to do. and I have managed to stay covid free .
0	I have never nor will I ever trust the government. That's one place my faith will never go
1	I have never seen so many people in such a dither about taking a stupid shot. Where were your rantings and ravings when you took the pneumonia shot, the shingles shot, measles shot, pneumonia shot? Now, here's one that stands a very good chance of possibly saving your life and you act like someone's taking your firstborn!!!!! What an EXCELLENT example of how grown, intelligent people are expected to act.
0	I have not been vaccinated and never had Covid. Everyone I know who has been vaccinated has all had it and gotten ill, including my sister (had 4 shots) who has had it 3 times!
0	I have not been “vaccinated” and I have never had COVID
1	I have nothing against people not having the vaccine, just don't turn up at Hospital wanting help.
0	I have serious concerns about the health industry. They fired all those that refused to push medication they had no idea were safe, and all those that did, are still there.
1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
0	I have thecovid and have the antibody in my system. Why do I need a vaccine
0	I have trouble trusting people who can't figure out if a mask can help, when they tell us, trust us the vaccine is safe.... oh by the way we not responsible when it goes wrong.
0	I haven't taken any vaccination ever since it was rolled out.
0	I heard a Dr. say a couple weeks ago that most people won’t see the effects from the shot until about 5 years after taking it
1	I hope Suptnik V is granted for Emergency Use. ✌✌ https://t.co/KwYgsd5C29
1	I hope l can get mine soon l am 67 and have health conditions been shielded for 4 weeks can’t wait till I can go out again
1	I hope the vaccines will save all the people around the world. God bless you all out there
1	I hope they make it mandatory so all these nut jobs don't ruin it for the rest of us.
0	I just automatically assume people who get the vaccine barely have the IQ to push a broom.
1	I just got 6 vaccines 2 days ago since my parents were pretty anti-vax, now they're just vaccine hesitant. I'm 18 now. I got dTPa, IPV, MMR, Meningococcal ACWY, Hep B (Paed), and HPV. Thanks to Medicare I got all of these completely free, and I'll be completely up to date in 4 months, and they were completely fine apart from both my arms being pretty sore and some brief but mild respiratory symptoms experienced yesterday.
1	I just got mine today 🙌🏼💉🦠 my arm hurts right there on the spot. That means is working 💪🏼
1	I just got my Pfizer biontec vaccine at UNC and I was thrilled to see your information on this to know about the vaccine in my body! Thank you so much!
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	I just got my second pfizer shot yesterday! I have been anxious about side effects but nearly 24 hours later and I haven't felt a thing. I'm so relieved! Excited to get back to living a normal life.
0	I just got over Covid smh thanks Trump for not taking it serious. Now we gotta live with this disease for the rest of our lives mutating smh
1	I just got vaccinated with moderna (mRNA) yesterday. So far so good I have no side effects
1	I just heard of a guy that was a denier. Caught Covid. Ask the doctor for one of those Miracle drugs that don't work and was denied. Got sicker went out to the store and bought an oxygen meter. Man got hospitalized after that. Didn't want to go because he didn't want them to put him on a vent. The idiots are out there people mask up
1	I just made my appointment for my first vaccine.
1	I just received my first dose today!
1	I just received the Moderna vaccine yesterday. No side effects except for a slight soreness at the injection site. I wish everybody can watch this video and hopefully everyone can get the vaccine when it’s available for them. We can get rid of this virus together.
1	I just spent an half an hour reading anti vax comments, I have lost faith in humanity.
1	I know it drives me crazy! These weirdos think taking Vitamins D, C and Zinc is somehow beneficial to their immune systems. Just get the vaccine people!!!
1	I know it sucks, but take it from a survivor, the long term side effects of being moderately sick from COVID is so much worse, one year later still, than a couple days of crappy feeling from getting the vaccine.
1	I know more people who've been vaccinated than people who've had COVID. So happy to see the rollout gaining steam!
0	I know quite a few Black people who aren't going to get the vaccine. I happen to be one of them.
0	I know someone who was vaccinated and was hospitalized in serious condition
0	I know that manufacturers refuse to vaccinate with their own vaccines
0	I know the vaccines were a dangerous fraud used only for control, but if you vaccinate almost all of a population, then almost all of those in the hospital will have been vaccinated. You could also say almost all those who are dying were fully vaccinated put that proves nothing.
0	I like listening to educated people telling me that the vaccine is still safe after someone that took it just up and died for obvious reasons. Helps me to make a common sense decision, lets call it a spidey sense! That's when i have to lookout!
0	I like my DNA exactly as God made it. No synthetic toxics and Nanotechnology into my body
1	I look at it as yes, there is some risk to the vaccine, since it's only been studied 3 months or so, but there is definite risk to Covid. I am high-risk so I'll chance it with the vaccine.
1	I lost my dad to Covid and I’m just 18. I told him many times to get the vaccine, but he was skewed by political views. It hurts a lot to see him gone. Im sorry if you rely on your news station to tell you what’s best for you. It is your decision. Don’t come to a decision and never look back. Stay open minded. Think about those around you. Life is precious
0	I love being unvaccinated
0	I love how people use “anti vaxers” as a way to belittle or dismiss them when quite frankly many of them have extremely valid intelligent arguments as to their stance.
0	I love how they had to admit here that it's completely experimental and not approved by the FDA, but they want to force you to take it.
0	I mean if the vaccines were worth a shit they would sell themselves - no need for all the forced vaccination initiatives.
1	I mean people should know that vaccines doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID. It only lower the risks of you dying having it.
1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk. that's why I can't get one
0	I never have taken one and I never will. I'm healthy and I'll take my chances without an unsecessary jab thanks!!
1	I once had a nightmare where Antivaxxers took over the UN and banned vaccines and Autism. Then there was a knock at the door. I woke up before I could open the door.
0	I personally know 2 people who have died within 48 hours of taking the second injection. One 68, the other 85. I'm never putting this into my system as I am elderly too
0	I prefer to rely on my natural immune system, nourished by real food that we were designed to eat, good hygiene and a healthy lifestyle.
1	I really appreciate this information. My entire family had no hesitation getting doubly vaccinated, except for our 10 year old grandson. There’s nothing available for him yet. We will also be getting a booster shot next year. I wish people would wake up.
1	I received my Moderna vaccine last weekend and was so relieved that I didn't get the worse side effects known by getting this vaccine. My arm was a little sore but this went away in a couple days. Hopefully, the last dose will arrive promptly.
1	I received the vaccine yesterday! i am in healthcare. i have only had a sore arm and a slight feeling of hotness. other than that i feel great!
0	I refuse to get the shot also my entire family. Sorry will not try it lol
0	I refuse to get the shot also my entire family. Sorry will not try it.lol
0	I refuse up get any vaccine that's this new
0	I regret taking this poison.
0	I reject your 666 inject!
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff.
0	I should never have taken it 😔 I hope my body will recover soon
1	I sometimes feel like antivaxers try there best to purposely get someone sick so they don't vaccinated how much sense does that make that will just make someone want to get vaccinated more.
1	I still see so many people say "I feel sorry for all of these unvaccinated people. It's really tragic how they've been misled!" At first I agreed, but at this point, they are adults who have made their decisions, and their decisions are ruining millions of people's lives. They need to be held responsible, rather than felt sorry for at this point.
1	I still think the odds are better than good and would take it. Send it to Ontario.
1	I stopped watching as soon as the lady started crying and said “none of us knows why”. I can only speak for myself, but as a member of the healthcare community, I have dedicated tens of thousands of hours into my education, research, clinical trials, etc. As a medical professional it kills me to hear people with zero education, experience or understanding preach to others about the “dangers” of vaccines! If you don’t have knowledge or experience changing a transmission, are you going to change it yourself or possibly take your vehicle to a professional to ensure the job is done properly? The same principle applies to medical advice!!! Would you rather Betty who has all of 100 hours of basic classroom education or a doctor who earned their degree, finished their clinicals, completed their residency and has 20+ years actual medical experience?
1	I sure hope so. I WANT one.
1	I tested positive last Thursday. I felt tired for three days and played a lot of video games. Isolating from the rest of my family was a bigger chore than the disease. Vaccinations work.
1	I think god just made covid 19 for eliminate all anti-vaxxers
0	I think the main reason is people are starting to realize these vaccines don’t work and all they are doing is making a bunch of criminals richer. These vaccines have been killing people, and this isn’t conspiracy theorists talking, the data is all there for anyone to see. The CDC has seen the data and they don’t care. They are more interested in keeping this money making machine going.
1	I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand. This kind of video needs to be more accessible and shared around on common media so people understand.
1	I think the vaccine is ok.
1	I think they will probably make limitations for your daily life if you don’t take the vaccine so you will be kind of forced to take it :/
1	I think this is very helpful information. Unfortunately, in Japan, there are a few people who are skeptical about vaccines. I hope that the correct knowledge will spread.
1	I thinks its beneficial. It helps your immune system resist the virus so that even if you do catch it, the symptoms will probably be not as severe.
1	I took both vaccines from pfizer and feel perfectly well, its my 10th day following the second shot. just a one day arm pain. Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1	I took my first dose of Pfizer's vaccine on Friday. I am happy.
1	I took the first Moderna vaccine 27 days ago. 14 days ago, my husband test positive for C-19 after he became symptomatic . My grandson and I tested five days later after my husband experienced symptoms. My grandson tested positive. I tested negative. I’am taking the second shot tomorrow! I’am a firm believer that the vaccine works!
0	I took vaccine from FLU when I was 10 with my brother it was so bad were seriously sick for 2 weeks very badly so since then don';t want to take any vaccines.
0	I took was forced to take 2 shoots , and after 9 months, now im having deep chest pain and lack of breath, im on my 30s, we will see what the medical exames reveal
0	I truly feel sorry for the people who got the jab. That thing is a ticking time bomb.
0	I trust my immune system more than the vaccines. So, No, thank u I better opt out for being a lab .
0	I trust that vaccine about as much as I trust the 2020 presidential election…
1	I try to explain it to anti vaxxers and they just say “I don’t believe that” it’s like playing chess with pigeons.
1	I used to be a Covid denier back in March of 2020, and thought it was some lame new strain of flu. It wasn't until one of my idols (Rick May) and relatives died of it that I started to realize this is serious. I'm so ashamed that it took people I looked up to dying to take this seriously. It's my biggest regret in life, I wish people would just listen instead of trying to be so self-righteous. Please everyone, stay safe, and like a good life. Update: I've now gotten my 3rd shot, and am hoping to be able to get the 4th. Stay safe, friends.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I’m still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I’m protected from a ton of disease.
1	I want to be vaccinated
0	I was 49 (UK male) when COVID hit and I felt under so much pressure from everyone to get the jabs, including my then 43 year old female partner. My health is not good. I just could not force myself to do it as I thought it was rushed out and so many drug giants were involved and they are all money driven. I tried my best to avoid getting COVID, but I did get it in the end. I was quite ill for a week, but not hospitalised. My partner had it at the same time, but she had 2 jabs and was nearly as ill as I was. I have had some issues since then with random pain around the heart muscle and shortness of breath for many months, but I am not convinced that this was COVID. I am still unvaccinated.
1	I was afraid to get vaccines because of my RA and allergies. But last week I had my 1st pfizer vaccines. On October 2nd will be the schedule for 2nd dose. At this point I can only say, " Que sera sera, whatevah will be... will be..."
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can’t trust science who can we trust? I’ll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
0	I was anti-mandate, not anti-vax, until the govt and media destroyed any trust I’ve had this past year.
1	I was born in 1951. The measles vaccine wasn’t developed until 1963. I got measles as did many of my friends. One friend ended up with heart damage and another went deaf. So you bet my kids were vaccinated on schedule. For everything.
1	I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 20 and my neurologist sat down with me and spent the time coming up with a list of medications that would work best for me and he went down each one and explained the pros and cons. I have a lot of respect for him and trust him. And as a scientist, I trust that vaccines do more good than harm.
1	I was fully vaccinated. When I caught Covid, I barely knew I had it. Everyone at the party had it, all vaccinated, and all had extremely mild symptoms. Can’t speak for everyone, but vaccines at least worked for the 50 people at one party.
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good thank you
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good thank you can’t blame these ladies at all
1	I was initially vaccinated in March 2021, and I got covid in August 2021, I only had some cough and a headache for the first few days. But I did very well and was so grateful I was vaccinated. Now I'm boosted 3 times.
0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it’s being forced. I’m definitely NOT getting it 😂.
1	I was unvaccinated and last October my family all tested positive during the height of delta. My parents in their 70s had their 1st shot and they got mildly ill. I was taken by ambulance to hospital, ended up in icu in an induced coma on a ventilator for 21 days followed by 1 month of rehab learning to walk again. I was revived one time during the intubation as they'd lost me. I'm now triple vaccinated.
0	I was vaccine neutral until this mRNA injection came along... RED FLAGS everywhere.
0	I wasn’t sure when to get my first one so I never did
1	I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
0	I will die before I get this vaccine I don't trust it
1	I will get it as soon as I'm able.
1	I will get whatever vaccine I can. I am not picky. I want this virus dead before it turns into something bigger, deadlier, or worst of all, something that our vaccines don’t work on.
0	I will never get Vax or tested I'm fine from day 1
0	I will never get a vaccine. I take a vitamin B, C, and D everyday. Haven't been sick in 2 years.
0	I will never give my children that poison.
0	I will never take dat poison!! You can have all my family’s doses!! Thank me later!!
0	I will never take it. And I had corona in Christmass week, very mild thank god! Natural immumity feels so good.
0	I will not be no one's lab rat !! Thank you .
0	I will not take it
0	I will not. I do not find enough info in the studies to trust
0	I will take my chances on a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate
1	I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!
1	I wish we could send people back in time to see what it was like when huge percentages of children died from diseases before they reached age 5. It would offer some much-needed perspective.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me I was sick for 6 months
1	I wonder how many people in the comment section are claiming this doctor’s lying. It’s like people would rather feed into fear than protecting themselves or others. Let alone getting things back to normal.
0	I wonder if the incompetent doctor and interviewer know that in some nations, the pandemic is over? And if they know the reason why? (hint: they have under 10% jab rate)
0	I wont take this vernomous poisons never
0	I won’t be forced to do anything. Me and millions and millions of other patriots.
0	I won’t take this ever. I’ll rely on my immune system thanks
1	I work at a nursing home and I can’t wait for this to come out to us
0	I work in emergency medicine and would NEVER pump that poison into my body. Created in God's image, not about to change that fact.
1	I work with a woman who got polio. She isn’t old and the vaccine was available to her but her mother made a choice and it costs this wonderful woman her health. After she got polio and ended up with a dreadful limp and would end up in a wheelchair for the majority of her life. Her life has been spent in so much pain and she was so limited in what she could do. She was an amazing actor and only got to do a little bit child. So I can’t image how the side effects could be worse.
0	I would NEVER consider myself an anti-vaxer but you gotta be out your damn mind to immediately take a vaccine that was characterized for being one of the fastest to make it through trials...
0	I would like to see doctors, politicians and rich people take the vaccine live on tv
0	I would never even experience those side effects you call "NORMAL"
1	I would rather deal with the issues of the vaccines than have my child die from those diseases that the vaccines have proven to prevent.
0	I would rather open fire on hundreds of people before I take the culling poison
0	I would wait 6 months to see how it affects people.
0	I'd be way more worried about getting the vaccine!
1	I'd love to see a vaccine that is strongly effective against you getting COVID and really stops the spread. Don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled for the vaccines we have. I'll continue to get whatever boosters are available and recommended. I don't doubt they've saved millions of lives. I went from seeing 40 year olds die of covid to seeing 95 year olds with few symptoms thanks to vaccines. I just miss that hope we had at the beginning of vaccines when we thought they were 98% effective.
0	I'd rather die, than let them change my DNA.
0	I'd rather take my supplements...... you can have my share of the vaccine
1	I'll happily take both vaccines if there are so many idiots who will forfeit theirs.
0	I'll hold off until all the beta testing has been completed and a true body count issued. Yeah, not expecting much in the way of the latter.
0	I'll never listen to anything another "doctor" has to say for the rest of my life.
0	I'll say no to a vaccine but I'll take a double triple bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four animal style, with a shimmy and a squeeze, burn it and let it swim
0	I'll take my chances with a 3 day cough instead of this vaccine.
0	I'll take my chances with the virus. Don't want to find out I can't have kids ones day because ya'll decided to rush this shit.
0	I'll take my chances without getting the vaccine! Thank you very much
0	I'll take my chances without the vaccine thank you.
0	I'm 5 vaccines behind and had covid why on earth would I start now!
0	I'm 5-times unvaccinated. From what I'm reading, I'll be refusing my 6th dose very soon
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel. Thank you Pfizer.
1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow
1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid
1	I'm an Aussie working as a Firefighter in the US. Got my second shot of the Moderna coved vaccine yesterday I have a bit of a headache and feel a bit tired but I also work 48 hours shifts so tired in nothing new. Get the shot Australia.
1	I'm beginning to think that anyone who still distrusts boosters should maybe go to China and see how that is working out for them. The shortage of hospital beds for Covid sufferers is truly horrifying.
1	I'm excited about COVID vaccines.
1	I'm getting a booster shot on Thursday while it's still free. Glad we finally have Covid under control. It was a long 3 years.
1	I'm getting my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today and this comes up. thank you for such an informative video
1	I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
0	I'm glad I didn't take any covid shots since my ticker is a little on the weak side. Getting the flu shot this year was bad enough, I got sick a fever and dental neuralgia, etc about a week after the shot.
0	I'm glad I'm not vaccinated with that Covid-19 vaccine.
1	I'm going now to get vaccinated
1	I'm hyped for this vaccine, even if I grow a third limb
1	I'm in Portugal and I'll take the first vaccine made available as soon as I can get one, that's the least I can do in the name of those who lost their lives and didn't get a fight chance.
0	I'm in US: I will not be taking this fast-tracked no-liability experimental Emergency Use Authorization NOT FDA-Approved synthetic mRNA wrapped in PEG gene therapy injection.
1	I'm in for vaccination and booster shot and also wearing a mask at all times.
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
1	I'm looking forward to the day(s) I get mine. Living in Europe however, it is unclear when this will be. Until that day follow advice and stay safe.
1	I'm needlephobic and I got my first vaccination. Scheduled for my second too.
0	I'm not an anti vax but I would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0	I'm not anti vaccine but I have my concerns due to how fast they are being rushed out. I may wait a few months first
0	I'm not getting it for at least 1-2 years. And only if the virus evolves and it's necessary to have a base immunity
0	I'm not getting the vaccine I dont trust it .
1	I'm not sure of how good of a nurse she will be if she doesn't believe in medicine.
0	I'm not taking it, as it has not been trialled for long enough. Nobody knows the long-term effects.
0	I'm not taking the vaccine. I don't trust it. I'm not sick either & i have a strong immune system. No way vaccine
1	I'm not worried about taking it, but I already had covid, so it would be in better use for someone who needs it.
0	I'm now 71 and, when my GP tried to coax me into having the Convid vaccine over two years ago, I refused because it had not be approved, and was still only a TRIAL DRUG and NOT a vaccine.
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone! 🎆💖🎄☃️☮️😊
0	I'm so glad I didn't too. Unbelievable that woman even had the gall to suggest it may not have been the vaccine. My experience is similar to this young lady's experience that of many many others personal experiences
0	I'm so glad that my family and I didn't participate in their experiment
1	I'm so glad we finally have a vaccine to protect the people who actually need it out there, let's end the war covid-19 together with our vaccines
0	I'm someone who NEVER gets allergies now after taking both doses I have ALLERGIES!
0	I'm sorry but a vaccine that was developed in such a short time cannot possibly have no side effects
0	I'm still amazed how my mum got Covid recently, ended up hospitalized (she's a risk group and had a bacterial lung coinfection), and all people seemed to ask were: But she did get all the vaccine doses? How easy it is to be brainwashed if you're not able to find or interpret "reliable" sources (this channel is gold for me). Glad I was considered an antivxx (which I'm certainly not, exceptions include vxs in trial phase with unknown and possibly severe common side effects), and glad my sense making skills seem to have helped me once again. People, PLEASE don't inject your healthy little child with this, and trust in their amazing immune system, since it will do more harm than good.
0	I'm still not taking that evil vaccine
0	I'm still not taking this vaccine. More people survive this plandemic then deaths. They push this harder than anything else.
1	I'm vaccinated, everyone I know is vaccinated. 95% of my country is vaccinated. I don't see any negative effects of this.
0	I've already had COVID so why get the vaccine. That is what no one will explain.
0	I've always been incredibly healthy and have rarely ever been sick which means that my immune system is rather alive and well. I have little concerns about catching the virus, and since I've grown aware of the possible dangers of obtaining the "vaccine", I know that I don't want, nor do I need the "vaccine".
0	I've been flush since I got it. I don't feel well and am always very tired. I would have not gotten if I knew this....
1	I've been fully vaccinated and so has my husband. I must know at least 100 other people who have been vaccinated and everyone is doing just fine. You paranoid maniac. Don't believe us. We're just evidence.
0	I've been saying these vaccines aren't good.
1	I've been vaccinated against polio, measles, typhoid, smallpox, tetanus, hepatitus c and a few others that I can't remember. I'll be having this one too. ISN'T SCIENCE WONDERFUL?
1	I've been waiting for Novavax! Thank God they are finally giving us an option other than mRNA.
1	I've been waiting for the full approval, got my first shot scheduled for about an hour from now.
0	I've had Covid twice I need a booster like I need a hole in my head. This is way more about money than it is about public health.
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions.
0	I've had months of chest pain after the moderna injection. Thanks, world!
1	I've just got my first dose. I am proud of such used technology. Hope to see its effect in other ways.
0	I've known so many who have had terrible reactions and heart problem. Even several deaths 😭 I'm so glad me and mine didn't get it!!!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice...
0	I've never got even one dose of covid19 vaccine but I'm still alive
0	I've not had the vaccine and I feel great!
0	IF SOMETHING IS FREE, THEN YOU ARE THE PRODUCT
1	IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR THIRD SHOT (or the vaccin at all) GET IT!!! Covid 19 is still a thing!
0	ILL NEVER TAKE THE VACCINE
0	ILL STICK WITH GOD'S IMMUNITY CAN'T BEAT PERFECTION!!!!!
0	IT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE (the consent form tells us) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR EVIL EXPERIMENT! It's as simple as that. STAND FIRM AND FIGHT! God said don't ever get the shot ....pray and confirm in JESUS name!
0	ITS NOT A VACCINE ITS A BIOWEAPON
1	Iam am pro-vax and don't want a rushed vaccine.
0	If 90% of infected have viable immunity why vaccinate them??
0	If I can’t sue them, I’m not getting the vaccine. Actually I won’t get the vaccine period.
0	If I was to get vaccinated it’s going to be in five years. Many things could go wrong such as late side effects. When people get a high dose of radiation, they don’t get cancer straight away it takes time.
0	If a 4th shot can't stop it, why would the previous 3?
0	If companies are so confident in their vaccines then they would be able to get sued for side effects
0	If it is so safe, why do they tell us they will not be held responsible for any adverse affects.
0	If it's going to take years anyway would it not have been better to just let it run its course?
0	If it's so great let's all vaccine companies get sued if things go wrong. Then people might take it.
0	If it’s 95% effective, what are the consequences to the remaining 5%? Is it side effects or death? Honestly, it has to be 100%. 95% is not yet perfect because in 100 people 5 will still be get (the infection)..?
0	If mRNA vaccines are totally new and have never been used before, why would the FDA think longterm side effects would reveal themselves within 2 months?
0	If me and my family were the only ones on earth not to take the injection....there is still nothing anyone could do or say or convince me to take this
1	If no one decided to take the vaccine, we wouldn't make any progress!
0	If the COVID vaccine is safe and effective why do the pharmaceutical companies have immunity from liability?
0	If the company is immune to being sued. Thats a super big RED FLAG
0	If the flu and COVID have similar mortality rates then why worry about it? Everyone doesn’t take a flu shot.....so why should anyone take a COVID shot?
0	If the government is pushing you to take something into your body be aware
0	If the super booster doesn't work, I'm sure Moderna will come up with a super super booster.
0	If the vaccine is so good you shouldn’t have to worry about the unvaccinated. Let them take care of them selves if they know the risks it’s up to them, you may not think it’s a human right to choose but it’s in the Nuremberg code matey, people are not to be experimented on without consent.
1	If they got covid because the refused to get a vaccine, I agree not to treat them
0	If they lockdown again, I won’t trust the vaccine to keep me safe. No matter what the “experts” say.
0	If they try to inject me with this vaccine I'm gonna inject them with lead
0	If they were so sure it was safe they would make it legal to sue the company
0	If this vaccine was truly studied and well researched we shouldn't have to even be asking this question. The fact that we are says a lot.
0	If vaccines are as safe as many say they are then why would the drug company require indemnity? And if they are as safe as they say then the company should carry the liability not the end user.
1	If we get enough people vaccinated in the entire population, there won't be as many people to care for infected with SARS-COV-2. Here's hoping we can get to that point sooner rather than later.
1	If you don’t want to get vaccinated, that’s your choice - but don’t think you are going to get on a plane or a train and put vaccinated people at risk
1	If you're still not vaccinated then I dgaf if you get covid.
0	If your immune system worked fine the first round why would you need to "boost" it with an experimental product that could introduce other harmful factors??? You are getting paid to say this aren't you? Come on... you can tell us we won't say a thing.
1	If you’re unvaccinated, you’re about 8 times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 than if you’ve had both doses of the vaccine and the booster.
0	If you’ve done your research from the real scientists you would know never to take this experimental gene therapy! 1,000’s have been injured or have died! This so called ‘vaccination’ isn’t even approved by the FDA! If you’re listening to Fauci you’re forked!!
0	If y’all can’t see by now that it’s never been about a “Virus” ... it’s solely about control.
0	If “vaccines” are so safe and effective, then why aren’t they safe and effective?
1	Ignorance is a gateway drug to conspiracy theorist. Unfortunately there is no vaccine for that.
0	Ill just quit my job and stay home to teach my kids and continue to grow my own food like we should be living while everyone else become part of the genetic dna altering experiment
0	Im a hospital worker and I officially got fired for not getting the shot. I took a stand so hopefully the mandate will stop with us. Good luck everyone. Dont cave
0	Im convinced the covid vaccine has messed up my immune system . Never had flu in my life before but now ive been ill for 5 weeks
1	Im from singapore . Already vaccinated and i feel strong
1	Im getting my covid vaccine
0	Im not having it, no way
1	Im pretty sure plenty rather have vaccine then catch covid
0	Im so disgusted with all the LIES. thousands are dying and mamed. STOP THE SHOTS NOW HOW MANY MUST DIE?
1	Im vaxed and feel AMAZING!!!!
0	Imagine a virus so deadly you need to be manipulated into taking the vaccine.
0	Imagine getting 4 vaccines in one year, still getting sick, and calling the unvaccinated people crazy
0	Imagine getting 4 vaccines in one year, still getting sick, and calling the unvaccinated people crazy.
1	Immunization can be achieved as soon as possible after vaccination
1	Important point! The vaccine is working. It’s not because Omicron is all that mild
0	In Africa we don't want poison
1	In October of 2021 I was next in line for the vaccine treatment, I got my first booster in April of 2022 and then again in late September 2022. On January tenth of 2023, I requested and received the current vaccination for the newest strain of the virus. I feel great. Oh by the way, I am nearly seventy !!
1	In here so I can answer my relatives when they try to cast doubt on vaccine on me.
1	Incredibly blessed to have gotten my second dose today. Feel lousy side effects but it’s worth it.
0	Individual responsibility to maintain your immune systems. It’s as simple as Vitamins C & D3, Zinc, Quercetin and I added Turmeric, NAC and vitamin K2. Haven’t been sick in 3 years and I noticed my spring time allergies have gone away. Not bad for someone in their 70’s And NOT vaxxed.
0	Individuals who had adverse reactions were IGNORED! How many lost their lives because the jab was NOT tested properly?
1	Injections beat infections!
0	Instead of the population, why the same scientists who designed it, don't receive the first shots if they are so sure it won't risk their health?
1	Internet moms: vaccines are safe-ish Well it's better than having your child dead-ish
0	Is there a coffin included with vaccine ? What about costs my family has to pay.
0	Is this fake vaccine the solution of this fake Corona?
1	It amazes me how many people would rather believe nonsense than the truth. People fear what they don’t understand.
0	It is not being an anti-vaxxer; it’s called making a sensible educated decision. Vaccines usually take 7 years to develop. I’m not willing to be a guinea pig for pharmaceutical companies
0	It is not that people are against vaccination but most people just feel that the vaccine will be rushed and without any knowledge of the long term consequences.
0	It is still in TRIALS until 2023... we are the LAB RATS. Sick twisted people every single one with a hand in this.
1	It seems to me that there’s nothing about these vaccines that should cause problems. They’re mRNA delivery services. After that, it’s just the body/cells processing mRNA, as it always does.
0	It takes more than 10 years for the side effects to appear and how they are releasing within one year this is just making us fool.
0	It was safe and effective, not? It was tested and the short term side effects were known, not? It was not a medical test run in the population, not? And probably it all has nothing to do with the gene therapy, not?
0	It wasn’t safe for Lisa Shaw and many more like her. It’s either safe for everyone or it’s not. Conclusion: not safe. You can’t say every death matters when it comes to covid and then put vaccine deaths down as collateral damage.
0	It will mess up your DNA
1	It would be great to have a vaccine before contracting the virus. More conventional and similar to the flu shot.
0	It's a big fat NO for me and my kids!
0	It's a no for me dog! Hard Pass!
0	It's amazing how adults are so easily told to do something and just blindly follow...question everything
0	It's called the vax of death
1	It's encouraging to hear that the covid 19 vaccine has minimal side effects, and is helping to reduce hospitalization rates.
0	It's funny how we were all raised not to be peer-pressured into taking experimental drugs, and now we're all being peer-pressured into taking experimental drugs.
1	It's gonna be like a fucking freight train. Once we pick up speed we're golden. Especially once Biden invokes DPA and it's all hands on deck.
1	It's gratifying to hear her call anti-vaxxers a cult. And it's scary to see how easily people became anti-vax.
0	It's not safe they are trying to mess with our DNA
0	It's one year since this virus started spreading so probably by now almost everyone have had it...no need for a vaccine
1	It's really important vaccinate all people in the airports of the United States. All people who travel to the United States. Thank you.
0	It's rediculous to say being hesitant to the vaccine has anything to do with getting poison injected into your body that it's about politics ! It's Poison and there are plenty cases that people get Covid19 after being vaccinated ! It's kept quiet and given different names trying to tell us the vaccine doesn't work in these people. Cases are popping up all over the US !
0	It's simple. If someone is pushing the vaccine, don't trust them.
0	Its gonna be a NO for me.
1	It’s almost like, and stay with me here, but it’s almost like the vaccines work!
0	It’s ruined my life, I was pro vax but the side effects are ongoing after 8 months and doctors are unable to help, not willing to report the effects. Sadly we will see that many won’t get the booster due to unreported side effects.
0	It’s so safe they need to promote it 24/7
1	It’s totally safe, they wouldn’t approve it if it wasn’t. Also the vaccine is based off other vaccine technologies that already exist that don’t harm people.
1	Ive been working as a volunteer trying to book people into get their vaccines, this video has some great easy to understand and relay information that I can let people know about so they feel safe and confident so thankyou.
0	I’ll be getting my vaccine on Neveruary 32nd.
0	I’ll pass for now, stay on unemployment, keep wearing masks, laying low, and taking supplements for my immune system...while going to school on line...
0	I’ll take my chances with getting covid. I don’t trust our government AT ALL
0	I’m a healthcare professional. I told my friends and family not to get it. Healthcare professionals learn about how vaccines are made and what is needed before they can be put out. None of that protocol was done. I took a lot of heat for refusing, but I’m glad I held my ground. This is just the beginning. Wait until the whole truth comes out. My condolences to people who lost their lives due to corporate greed!
1	I’m a week out of my pfirst Pfizer vaccine and pso pfar pso good. I haven’t experienced any pside effects, and I’m pfeeling pretty pfenomenal
0	I’m against this vaccine.
0	I’m against this vaccine. I was referring to people who decide to get it just because of videos like this.
1	I’m confused because if people don’t want to listen to medical professionals or get vaccinated, why do they come to us at the hospital for help when they get sick ??
1	I’m conservative and I always wear a mask. I got the Pfizer vaccine.
0	I’m definitely not getting it !
0	I’m definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity.
1	I’m fine and I don’t know of anybody around here who has had problems with the vaccine.
1	I’m fully dosed!
1	I’m fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I received moderna and developed disequilibrium a few days after my second dose. It’s been 5 months and it still comes and goes. Have 3 friends with the same issue after moderna. Maybe it’s unrelated. But I really doubt it.
0	I’m glad I’m not alone. I think I’m the only person in my company who has refused the vaccine. I will not take it.
1	I’m just glad I’m educated enough to not abuse my children by preventing them from being Vaccinated.
1	I’m loving all the people who know nothing about developing vaccines giving their take in the comments
0	I’m not against vaccines at all. I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
0	I’m not an antivax I just don’t trust the covid one
0	I’m not getting this political vaccine
1	I’m not gonna lie, that vaccine recovery was worse then wisdom teeth removal for me...but I’d rather have three days of pain that weeks on a ventilator any day!
0	I’m not taking an mRNA ever. It’s DNA ALTERING
0	I’m not taking the vaccine AND I’m not taking off my tinfoil hat!
1	I’m over 40 and have had 4 doses and my immune system is doing just fine. All of my family and relatives have been vaccinated and they are all alive and well.
0	I’m so glad I took a wild guess and didn’t get vaccinated despite constant propaganda, peer pressure, and social ostracism.
1	I’m so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1	I’m sorry America is privileged and DOESNT take advantage of these privileges where as other places are struggling to get this vaccine. I apologize once again.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated
0	I’m still not gonna take it, I don’t trust a vaccine that has been made in 9 months, when its supposed to take 5-10 years to even make and get trusted.
0	I’m trying to get pregnant, has it been tested to ensure that it will not affect my reproductive organs or compromise future pregnancy. The vaccine is just too new. We don’t know the long-term side effects.
0	I’m unvaccinated and I’m perfectly fine…my friends who got vaccinated are always getting sick . Non of this is true….I had the Delta..got sick like having a flue..took my vitamin C and D…HVE NOT BEEN SICK EVER SINCE.
1	I’m up to date ! Received last vaccine in September
1	I’m up to date and glad I am! Will keep following the recommendations.
1	I’m watching this now and I just got my vaccine yesterday. I want to stay safe for my mom which has diabetes.
1	I’ve got 2 shots and 2 boosters and I’m still alive along with my Sister, niece, nephew, wife, MIL, BIL friends and cousins. We still healthy and alive.
1	I’ve gotten the vaccine. It is perfectly safe lmao
0	I’ve had covid. So has my husband. I’d rather have it over and over again each year than take vaccine. I’m not okay with being lab rat for virus that has high recovery rate.
1	I’ve had my first dose of the oxford vaccine and can verify myself and family and friends who have had it had no serious side effects at all.
1	I’ve had one more vaccination than most due to a minor immune deficiency. No reaction. No one I know has had a reaction. And when I finally caught Covid, being vaccinated probably saved my life.
1	I’ve had three doses, as have all of my kids and coworkers, and no, no seizures, or any other effects.
0	I’ve never heard anyone regret not taking the covid vaccine. But I keep hearing people regret taking it.
1	I’ve received both of mine! It’s nice to know I can protect myself, my patients and my family.
1	I’ve taken the moderna vaccine. I’ve gone on multiple 5 plus mile runs since then and everything is fine so far. After my first dose I felt extremely fatigued for a couple of days but that’s it. I get my second dose on July 3rd.
0	Johns and Johns is just a bad company lawsuit, now blood clots, I never us their products
0	Just a realistic point of view from a vaccine hesitant person (I am currently studying to be a nurse btw so understand how vaccines work) While I agree with most of what he said I'm still going to wait out as long as I can getting the vaccine. I think he downplayed the fact that you are still able to transmit the virus after vaccination, the window of time is reduced a fraction still and also still being able to contract Covid after vaccination, given the vaccine isn't as effective on the delta strain. Overall this reduces the protection it offers. Also the long term effects. Not one person can 100% say it's completely safe, not doctors, scientists, microbiologists, pfizer or the government know for sure. That is a matter of time. As far as data being collected it looks promising but I'm still just going to roll with natural immunity if I should contract covid. We have an immune system for a reason. My whole family abroad has had it, all 23 and they managed to survive without bad affect..even my 89 year old grandmother..was a bit rough on her but she got through it. Anyone who says you'll turn into a lizard or it has microchips in the vaccine is just trolling that's not even a serious myth to debunk.
1	Just because it happened to one guy, it doesn't mean it'll happen to every one of us. How many people die from medications for other diseases? Why hasn't that been put out on the news?
1	Just because vaccines aren’t perfect doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not working.
1	Just finished my first shift volunteering at the local Covid-19 vaccination centre and I got vaccinated as well!
1	Just got mine right now! Feeling great.
1	Just got mine this week, no side effects except some pain in my shoulder but it's not that big of a deal, like i hit the door or something
1	Just got my first Pfizer vaccine and it was very easy, it’s impressive the efficiency and organization I’ve seen at several of these vaccination locations.
1	Just got my first dose today. My arm is sore but I'm happy.
1	Just got my first dose u should really get the shot
1	Just got my first!
1	Just got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you’ll be happy and glad you’re done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1	Just got my second!!
1	Just got my vaccine today, couldn't be more grateful and excited, so far so good
1	Just got my vaccine today. Nice to know how this stuff is working around and how it came to be! Thanks to all the doctors, researchers, and essential workers who made this possible
0	Just got over my bout with COVID. Didn't need the "Vaccine". Don't let the media scare you into getting something you don't need. The "vaccine" doesn't cure or prevent COVID. So what good is it?
1	Just had my first dose of Sinovac Vaccine yesterday and my left arm (where I was injected) felt sore the entire day and had a slight fever and headache. Apart from that, everything's great. Will have my 2nd dose on June 2nd.
1	Just had two days with high fever after my second Moderna shot. However, I won't complain, as I appreciate the privilege to receive this incredible high-tech product, which clearly initiated a strong immune reaction with the second dose.
1	Just signed up for my first dose, but really anxious about the side effect of it making me sick as im a type 2 diabetic that already takes forever to get over sickness, but hoping for the best
1	Just want to say thanks for explaining this! This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.
1	Karens: "tHeRE'S nOThIng nAtUraL aBOUt VAcINes!1!!11" Immune System: *does 80% of the work of a vaccine*
1	Keep it going Moderna and thank you. Completely agree we have an engineering problem. We need the military to take over once these products come off the production lines and deliver the shot - no pun intended.
1	Keep making those doses. Good work.
0	Keep your poison
0	Kids don't need the poison shots. They are perfectly safe without it.
0	LIES - I wonder if you both can be sued? Keeping this if a family or friend die after taking this POISON!
1	Lasts 3 times longer than natural immunity, wow, this is amazing progress
1	Less than 1 in a MILLION side effects which is less than aspririne, less than having a plane fall on your head and even less than eating common food
0	Let me make this clear I have no duty to save anyone by getting vaccinated ive had none of your poison and never intend to
0	Let the rich take the shots first
1	Let's appreciate and applaud the doctors for helping us all
1	Let's get vaccinated!
1	Let's not forget the time people thought A&W's third pounder burgers had less meat than McD's quarter pounders. Numbers are hard for some people.
0	Lie. The best way to protect yourself from viruses is with a healthy robust immune system, which vaccines can actually damage.
0	Lies. All lies. We are NOT stupid, ignorant, nor uneducated. Stop speaking to us like we are.
1	Listen guys... I realize that some people have had adverse reactions to vaccines; but what you must realize is that it's generally a small minority of people that have any kind of severe reaction to a particular vaccine. If you weigh the benefits to the drawbacks, it just makes way more sense to get the vaccine, rather than risk getting Covid and having a severe reaction.
1	Literally just got my 2nd moderna shot 45 seconds ago! Woooo
0	Lol, well you sure rushed the first batch of poison through didn’t ya
1	Love science!
1	Love the real information about why vaccinating people is a positive thing for us humans. This is actual research and not people assuming vaccination prevents COVID, it doesn’t. I still stand with people having their personal decision regarding the vaccine.
1	Love the vaccines. I think people should be encouraged to take as many as they can hand;e and boosters when they are available This is a great channel I heard that every doctor in the uk and every person working for the nhs and government and all the MP’s have had the vaccine and they’ve declared it publicly. (But I can’t find the website which shows this) So it’s obviously safe Thanks for sharing
0	MRNA vaccines have been tried and tested on animals for years, there was severe side effects on the animals, these vaccines were rushed trough the testing process...no MRNA vaccines for me thank you.
1	Mail it to me.
0	Man I can't wait until I get this mysterious poison injected into my arm! It will save me from that virus that I haven't seen one person suffer from
1	Man imagine being one of those kids that never paid attention in high school and now thinks that all science is fake and that this vaccine is some brainwashing poison made by the government. Crazy what happens when kids are raised to not respect nor value the exact science meant to keep them alive longer.
1	Mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations are the way to go. Maximum suppression is the best approach to isolate this virus, and the only way to make it safe to reopen schools from kindergarten through college.
0	Many companies’ vaccines have been revealed to be defective
0	Masks don’t work, COVID vaccines don’t prevent transmission
0	Maybe moderna can tell us about the mice that died during the SARS COV -1 mRNA trials? And maybe a follow up question to see if they studied second time covid-19 exposure post injection because im just confused that they weren't concerned about all the mice dieing upon second contact of sars cov-1 after injection.
0	Maybe someday, there will be a safe and effective Covid vaccine… but for now, I wouldn’t touch that damn stuff with a 10 foot pole.
0	Maybe we have this misery BECAUSE of masking and vaccination.
1	Me and my whole office did Sputnik-V. Half a year later no problem so far!
0	Mmm for someone to say that vaccines are completely safe they are 100% liars because no medication or man made product is 100%
1	Moderna side effects are rough, but I ll take it over catching Covid-19 again. It sucks big time!!
0	Moderna stock prices will be held up as long as they need to be for you to keep investors happy so yeah it's "safe"
1	More good mRNA news!
0	Most are not anti vaxxers though, they just don’t want to take a shot that was made in 9 months.
0	My 19 year old grandson has friends with vax injuries that have not resolved. One friend is still hospitalized. Of COURSE doctors refuse to report it being related to getting the jab
0	My Grandmother died of a heart attack after getting booster shots in ‘21.. I talked to her about being sure if she wanted to do it.. if it was healthy and right for her. .I miss her so and I truly believe it had a hand in her passing. Love you Mawmaw.
0	My aunt just got the second moderna and is feeling pain from head to toe.
1	My baby got his first Covid vaccine today and I feel like such a weight has been lifted!
0	My best friends boss died 5 days after getting the vaccine. He took second shot, got very sick, was in hospital for 4 days, then on day 5 they discharged him. AS he was walking out of the hospital, he dropped dead. Turns out he died from a blood clot. Very healthy middle aged man who had no health issues, was on no medication etc.
0	My body my choice!
0	My body, my choice, and I'm not even trying to delete an unborn innocent.
1	My brother caught it (unvaccinated) and gave it to me (breakthrough - I'm double vaccinated). I had a head cold. My brother ended up in the hospital and died from covid pneumonia. I have asthma and diabetes.
0	My brother dropped dead three days after 1st booster. 58 years old. None of this is happening by accident.
1	My brother had (predicted) complications from his measles vaccine (and other vaccines) as a kid, but he had a somewhat underdeveloped immune system in his early childhood, so if he'd gotten actual measles, he would've likely died. He got a fever for a few days and was groggy for a while. Nothing else happened, except he didn't get sick from these horrible diseases. And he was somewhat of a worst-case-scenario and he's fine. Now he's 20 and healthy. Vaccinate your kids, peeps, or they may not make it as far as he did.
0	My children and I have all had our vaccines but my children or myself will not get the covid vaccine
0	My condolences to all those who got the vaccine.. We will miss you
0	My cousin contacted me to say her husband's friend died shortly after being vaccinated enough said
0	My coworker just took the covid vaccine and his lungs immediately filled with liquid. He couldn’t breathe the next day and had to go to the emergency room. The doctor put him in a medically induced coma for 5 days to drain the fluid and now he has permanent lung damage.
0	My dad got vaccinated and he still got sick than ever before
1	My dad over age 60 is scheduled to get a vaccine within weeks, we'll get it later due to eligibility.
0	My dad works in an assisted living facility where covid vaccines were administered to every resident. Within 5 days of giving vaccines, 3 residents died. All were physically heathy. The facility, state, and vaccine company refuse to say the vaccine had anything to do with it. No media coverage either. There is massive silencing of covid vaccine related deaths around the world.
1	My dad’s friend is unvaccinated and has gotten COVID three times…The first time he was hospitalized. He has numerous comorbidities and has suffered from long COVID. You’d think three times is enough to convince you to vaccinate, but I guess not.
1	My doctor is an Osteopath and she recommends the jab, as does her whole practice.
1	My ex husband and his brother refused to be vaccinated. As a nurse, I tried to explain how vaccinations work, but to no avail. Both got COVID. My ex accepted treatment with monoclonal antibodies, but still refuses the vaccine. His brother DIED from COVID. Even being tragically affected by COVID, my ex husband continues to refuse to even wear a mask. It’s insane.
0	My exhusbands father just died 2 weeks after getting his 2nd shot. I'm good. I do not need to get the shot. I wear a mask and stay out of big public places. Take vitamins people... Stay safe!!!
0	My family and I don't believe of the vaccine !! So we pass !! We will never take them nooooooo wayyyyyy !!!!!
1	My family got the boosters. It saved us. Being immunocompromised is nothing to play around with.
0	My family got the vaccine. My mom now has a bad heart, my uncle had a stroke, my dad can't move his arms, and my brother has constant sinus infections.
0	My family is fully vaccinated but as for this experimental vaccine we're not going to take it yet we're young enough that we will survive if we get the virus and if it's safe we'll take it in the future
1	My family will all get vaccinated hoping that if enough people do that we can still halt this thing. Covid is evolving, if we don't halt it's spread, we will be facing something worse.
0	My father(a doctor) got vaccinated yesterday and he has been ill ever since. I’m honestly getting more skeptical of this vaccine because there have been many cases of people dying because of the vaccine.
1	My first jab of the Moderna I had a sore arm for a couple of days. My second jab of the Moderna I felt like I had been run over by a truck. Well, maybe by a small child driving a go-cart. It was unpleasant, but not brutal. And I would do it again knowing what was coming.
1	My friend made fun of me for wearing a mask and my fear about covid. He got covid including his family. He got cured but His father died. His whole family under depression for months. Now they started again being ignorant. There is no cure for stupidity
0	My friends kid died from the second pioson shot. My friend had a brain clot. Wow. This is a Satan shot. It's evil
0	My girl has been losing her hair ever since she got the shot. Do not get it
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	My household are fully vaccinated.
1	My husband and I are seniors. We have 4 children who have been thankfully vaccinated. None of our grandchildren have been. Two of our grandchildren have had Covid. They say they have antibodies and don’t need the vaccine!!! One is a travelling RN and does not want to be vaccinated. One is getting married and his future wife and he are not getting vaccinated. This is very disturbing. We will be masked at the wedding for our safety. The article is so informative and I will send it along to everyone including our entire family.
1	My husband and I were just boosted last week. Thank God we were. He tested positive for Covid early this week. It’s going around his workplace. He’s felt fine. Vaccines work!
1	My husband, my Dad, and I are getting our first vaccination tomorrow. We are happy to get it.
0	My immune system will be my protection.
0	My kids will never get one
0	My lawyer was fully vaccinated and died of covid.
1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer. Tired the day after but that was it.
0	My mom died a few days after taking the 2nd vaccine shot, this last Saturday March 27th. I’m completely lost. She was just fine
1	My mom is 87, she received the COVID vaccine ( 4 of them) and she is in great health!
0	My mom said that I am one in a million, so, I'm opting out of cvid 19 vaccinations.
1	My mother is 98 years old. She has taken 4 shots and is just as healthy now as she was when she took the first shot.
1	My mother is 98 years old. She has taken 4 shots and is just as healthy now as she was when she took the first shot. This woman is a nut.
0	My mother took this vaccine on 3rd April and today is 9th she is covid positive
0	My natural antibodies are the vaccine! I’m not taking anything that isn’t approved or tested on humans for a long period of time.
1	My parents all grew up during the 50s/60s. They all knew multiple families that lost children to measles. I was pretty much vaccinated for anything they could get me for and I am perfectly healthy. Vaccinate your children, it saves lives.
1	My rabid anti-vaxxer cousin has persuaded her nearly 80YO mother not to get her boosters. My aunt recently had a stroke. My cousin thinks she's doing the right thing. The misinformation leads to insanity.
0	My sister is going through horrific symptoms after taking the covid vax. She tried to tell us what was happening, but we didn’t believe her until her symptoms got so bad, we were able to finally see what was happening! It’s horrifying to watch a beautiful, vibrant business woman, turn into a zombie-like creature. Dementia symptoms, uncontrollable jerking, tremors, tics. She has difficulty eating and drinking. No vax for me after seeing her like this!!
1	My sister was tired and had head aches, but my aunt and uncle had it really hard. They said this was hard I don’t want to imagine the real deal.. so glad we all get vaxed
0	My sister works for one of these biotech companies that make the vaccine and she said it's all about the money.
0	My state stopped using this vaccine period. I’m thankful for that
0	My turn? I am unvaccinated and untested and covid free for two years. Did I miss "my turn" ? Thank God.
0	My uncle died of a bloodclot in the brain after 2nd dose. After 1st dose he became ill and suffered from fatigue. He never tested positive for covid so our family all refused vaccine as we all recovered from virus without bs vaccines. RIP Eric
0	My uncle had two doses of Covid a month later he passed away.
0	My uncle took the Moderna shot on Friday March 12. He started feeling bad within 30 minutes. He died within 4 hours.
1	My whole family and I had our vaccine. Slight headache and fatigue first dose of Pfizer but felt completely fine the 2nd dose. I recommend NOT to get the doses in the same arm! That will keep you from having the swelling or irritation. My peace of mind is something I haven't felt since this pandemic started...some actual hope and protection. Don't be afraid. You will be fine and you will feel so much better and the peace of mind alone is worth it.
0	My wife had to get vaxxed to keep her job. Now she can’t work because of the side effects. Please pray for us
1	My wife was fully vaccinated and I got covid(very mild symptoms) and we quarantined at our apartment and she never tested positive.
0	NEVER would I put that Fauci sauce in my arm let alone my child’s
0	NO COVID 19 HERE IN BURUNDI. WE ARE ALL WELL AND SAFE, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM ABROAD ONCE THEY REACH HERE THEY ARE COVERED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS, SO, THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING THIS SATANIC VACCINE. AWAY FROM US IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
0	NOT going to take this man's advice. No thank you. And NONE of these people have the RIGHT to force ANOTHER person to put something INTO their body that they do NOT want.
0	Nah.. nah..nah.. vaccine sounds so creepy to me, Boost Your own Immune System Peoples !!!
0	Nature immunity, artificial immunity comes with risk.
0	Needing a booster every couple of months shows how shady this is, it feels like it is making the body dependent rather than independent
1	Never crosses their selfish minds that other people with different diseases, accidents etc. are also dying because of them.
0	Never ever I don’t want to I don’t trust any vaccines
0	Never for me! Took the chance by having 2 AZ ones, I’m done now!
0	Never forget, they emotionally blackmailed the children for use as paper shields, to "save" Grandma.
0	Never getting the mRNA shot.
1	Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that a deadly virus could target a certain mindset....lol
0	Never known so many people with stroke, heart attack, cancer, copd, blood clots, repeat Covid infection, and liver failure in my life. They all have one thing in common. I’m glad I knew what was going on and didn’t succumb to the pressure. I think in the coming years we will see it’s so much more widespread than anyone can imagine.
0	Never take anything that has not had years of testing and "learn as we go" is the response to logical questions.
0	Never wanted it, will never have it. My body, my right, and anything against that is against basic human rights.
0	Never will I ever get that vaccine LOL
0	New technology that's barely been tested, and the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility if things go wrong. I'm definitely not taking it
1	Nice video, it's gave so much of relief..now in India second wave is at peak, thousands of death daily.... I got vaccinated with covidsheild....feeling better after watching your video....I am safe... even I get infected after vaccination... No risk of hospitalization of death.... Thank you Nicely explained beautiful animation
0	No chance I'm taking it. Keep your toxins psychopaths
0	No covid 19 vaccines its not safe its not protecting its killing people..only GOD can protect us nothing else
0	No healthy person under 60 needs this vaccine
0	No need to ramp up production on my account.
0	No needle here. Had covid, recovered fast , within 10 hours. Now folks are fully vaccinated and boosted and have caught this more than once.
1	No negative effects please get vaccinated
0	No one is forcing me to take that poison.
0	No thank you.
0	No thanks I trust in the lord to keep me well
0	No thanks I'll see what people look like in 5 years who had the jab if they are still living!
0	No thanks, i'll stick to my own immune system.
0	No vaccine ever. You will not inject something I don’t want in my body
0	No vaccine for me
0	No vaccines are any good for you
0	No vaccines or mask. Open the country and start living again without fear.
0	No way I'm taking this poison there going to have to force me or arrest me.
0	No way am I getting hurt by Flu vaccines again! No jab for me!
0	No way in hell I'll ever take the jab!
0	No way, it is not a vaccine it is an experimental drug.
0	No you can’t force me and you will not! I will get a different job if my employer mandates it, which they are about to, so I’m already looking at the many backup options.
0	No, I wont take it for sure! I don’t believe that this ‘virus’ is as deadly as they say firstly. Secondly the ‘vaccine’ is of no use at all.
0	Nooooope- after the effects of the last booster- you have lost all credibility with me-NO
0	Nope enjoy you side effect crap
0	Nope not taking a rushed experimental vaccine
0	Not "vaccinated', never will be. Particularly as I personally know 3 people who had severe heart problems after being "vaccinated", and one died.
0	Not a single person in the world regrets not getting the you know what.
0	Not all of us are simple minded sheep like special interests were hoping.
0	Not clear on why the aches and pains show up - analogy of no pain no gain doesn't cut it based on your own description of what it does - also what kind of nano particles are being used youvrather glossed over thst part?
0	Not enough time for data
0	Not going anywhere near that hospital, even if my life depends on it.
0	Not in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1	Nothing terrifies me more than seeing the increasing amount of cavemen who are against science. I expect at least 14 replies about why I should be as well. I can't wait
1	Now if only the conspiracy theorists actually cared about facts.
0	Now lets watch the NHS get really overwhelmed with the side effect patients from the vaccine
0	Now that we have medical journals especially the one from dr asheem malhotra...do the interviewer admit it is very likely the vax is the cause of the seizure etc?? Be honest...we all will be responsible for things that we do and say...
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types! 🤣
1	Number 2 baby! Arm already sore #Vaccinate
1	Nursing homes and other residential institutions need to keep up on vaccines and boosters.
1	Odd, as a man living with HIV for 23 years, and vaccinated twice plus two boosters, my T Cells were just tested and were by far the highest they've been in 15 years. One might almost think Sherry Tenpenny is lying.
0	Of course it won’t hurt you immediately duh. The side effects kicks in later.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1	Of course.Most of all to be a patriot and protect all other humans.
1	Ok I’m thankful for this video, I was scared to get the covid vaccine because of the rumors but I get it now
1	Once again #GetVaccinated #GetVaccinated #GetVaccinated
0	One day Pfizer and Moderna execs will be in jail !!!! And the media for lying to everyone and our gov that forced it upon us
1	One of the things I liked about the vaccine is I felt like shit for 24 hours after the booster, but then when I did catch COVID I was neither hospitalized, nor did I die. I’ve often regarded feeling unwell for 24 hours as better than dying.
0	One thing about being a so called conspiracy theorist is that I will not have to worry about any of the side effects
0	Only a fool would take another needle from the government at this point
1	Only in America would people protest against getting a vaccine that would protect you and your family from a virus.
0	Only trusting in the Lord.
1	Out of all the people I know that got vaccinated, it was safe and quick for them
1	PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND GET VACCINATED!!
1	Parents not permitting vaccines is child abuse.
1	Parents who opt out of vaccinations should opt out of Public school. A parent has a right to a safe school environment for their children and children that are unvaccinated pose a threat. Since schools are funded by both State and Federal Governments those people who don’t believe in government vaccine protocols shouldn’t go to public schools. A parents rights end when it puts other children at risk.
0	People are foolish to get this vaccine unless they have underlying health issues that make the risks worth it.
1	People are going to get it - but if you can avoid it being all at once, it helps tremendously. THIS IS AWESOME to help explain to children and teens, especially. Thank you!!
1	People are so stupid nowdays, I can't believe random people in the comment section think they know any better than medical professionals that went through extensive education for 12+ years and spent even more time in this field.
0	People die because of it. The last one I know of is the doctor who got the vaccine and died 16 days later. So for me no thank you
0	People dying from vaccines!
0	People need to research this crap. Good luck sheep
1	People who are unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die from covid than those fully vaccinated with a booster!! Get your free, easy to find vaccines today!
1	People who don't get vaccinated are not only endangering themselves, but those around them. Highly irresponsible.
1	People who refuse the vaccine should have to pay private for COVID treatment. These anti vax morons are so thick I doubt they can spell their own name without deep, deep thought.
1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are like people who refuse to wash their hands after using the restroom.
0	People who refuse to take the vaccine are the 21st century Rosa Parks.
1	Pfizer is better because it targets the spike protein. So it's more efficient for both the original covid19 but also for variants.
0	Pfizer mrna is dangerous god bless natural immunity
0	Pharma Industry = Big Scammers
0	Phase 3 trials won’t be completed until 2023 so are we the test subjects?
1	Planning on getting my vaccine shot really soon!
1	Please announce early as possible that vaccine is free far all please.
1	Please get vaccinated and safe yourself and orhers
1	Please get vaccinated. Vaccines aren't political. Although this one is not 100% perfect, it will keep you out of the hospital with near certainty.
0	Poison vaccines
0	Poison. That’s all to it folks!
0	Poor people think that vaccines gonna save their lives x
0	Pray for those who took these shots
1	Protect yourself and protect others. Every shot counts. Congrats, you're doing the right thing.
1	Proud to have had both my shots. I know I can still get it but chances are it won't kill me.
0	Proudly unvaccinated and 100% immune to adverse vaccine effects. Alliance Against Myocarditis!
0	Pushing a vaccine for a virus with a high recovery rate? And not Health? Shameful!
0	REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE A SEVERE SIDE EFFECT OR DIE YOU CANT SUE
1	Rather than attempting to shame those who've been offered the vaccine, support and encourage them. After all, as more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for everyone--including you.
1	Received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday and besides a little injection site pain I’ve felt no symptoms.
1	Received my first Pfizer Vaccine yesterday evening, woke up with nothing but a sore arm, fatigue and a slight headache. Nothing a little over the counter medicine won't help! Definitely prefer these symptoms vs the alternative!
0	Research bla bla bla... But the truth lies in the time.... Long term.... Only time will tell if there is any long term effects... That is something studies don't know... Yet. So that is still a potential risk nobody really wants to mention.
0	SHAMEFUL GOVERNMENT!!! GREED over human safety. Pretense and fear for control!
1	Sadly if you do not believe the science on the Covid vaccine, you cannot believe the science on diabetes, stroke, heart attacks, appendicitis, etc. Best to be your own doctor & not take any of those meds or surgical interventions that might help. Yes?
1	Sadly, the anti-vax infectivists and the CDC-haters have arrived to promote their anti-vax disinformation. Modern vaccines have been proven safe. And yes, all vaccines are indeed vaccines. Don't allow yourself to be bamboozled by these nitwits, spewing their anti-vax malarkey.
0	Safe and effective and yet the first thing the pharmas did before releasing the vaccine into a country was to get full immunity from prosecution from anything related to the vaccine.
0	Same time next year I will still be VACCINE FREE!
0	Say NO NO NO to getting the vaccine.
0	Say, “No way Jose” to the vaccine!
1	Science is real!!!!!
0	Serious question: Now that even the government is admitting the vaccines do almost nothing to stop the spread of Omicron, what is the "scientific" justification for vaccine mandates in the workplace?
0	She is so confident that the science and statistical data is flawless when the science and statistical information has been skewed or incorrect this entire time. She needs to be more open minded to the possibility that these negative side effects might be happening at a much larger rate than what is being reported.
0	Short answer, no.
1	Show me the scientific data to back up the idea that the vaccine doesn't help prevent COVID or doesn't make the symptoms less severe.
1	Side effects: reaching adulthood, not dying , chance of not getting sick
1	Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	So all the old people who died within 28 days of a faulty test definitely died of covid but those old people who died after the vaccine definitely didn't die of the vaccine. Ok.
0	So far there's no sufficient evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission. Me taking it won't protect someone else's life. I'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. It might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. Human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway.
1	So glad I’m not anti vax nothing happened to me getting all of them
0	So glad I’m not going to be taking the vaccine.
1	So happy to have had my first covid vaccine
0	So if i die from vaccine it,that doesnt matter as long as i am protecting others by taking something that might kill me??
1	So if i have 4 doses and my last was in September 10 can i take a new one, i mean the fifth dose?
0	So let's see same shots same outcomes same problems same injuries same medical conditions same autism but vaccines no connection LOL
1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine.
0	So we DOOOOO have an immune system that can heal us without introducing unstable vaccines with little research and no long term cause information.
0	So when I say, "y'all are guinea pigs, don't get mad. For y'all taking that poison. Fat meat is greasy, and sugar is sweet. Can't say ya wasn't warned.
0	So you Knowillingly are injecting the public with toxic poison then?
0	So...who's still going to get any of the vaccines? Glad I didn't!
0	Some employers are making it mandatory to get it or be fired. I would have to be fired, cause I'm not getting it.
0	Some side effects are normal like death
0	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it
0	Sorry our human rights have been stripped away, fuck the jabs
1	Sounds useful. Reliable protection for people willing to get the vaccine sounds great. As for antivax cranks, they're gambling with other people's lives and I am long since out of sympathy.
0	Stay away from me with that crap!
1	Stay safe, and get a COVID vaccine as soon as you can.
0	Still never taking this poison shot 🖕
0	Still not putting that shit in my arm.
0	Still pushing the shots here in Canada as well, right down to very young children. It is unimaginable and unforgivable .
0	Stop corona vaccine it’s dangerous there are many dangerous symptoms for this vaccine
1	Stop panicking the word here is "rare"! As for the people not now going to have the Vaccine because of this risk, do you or your partner still take the contraceptive pill? As that is known to also cause blood colts!! Everything runs a risk!
0	Stop poisoning the children
1	Such a fantastic video, thank you! I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.
1	Such a sad situation. Get the f-king vaccine. Don’t be a smart-ass.
1	Sure hope there is a great cure fer it an hopefully there isnt anymore coming . it is a real bad thing . Stay home everyone if you can please.
0	Swine flu vaccine has caused narcolepsy in a good few people in Ireland, recent case settled linked below. There wasn't nearly as much pressure (or profit to be had) to be first to market with that vaccine compared to that of Covid now. I'd definitely be slightly hesitant to be first in line for a Covid vaccine.
0	THIS IS NOT RIGHT. You can't force this apon people. Stand up for your rights people
1	Take the vaccine or don’t take it. Just stay tf away from those us that value our lives enough get vaccinated, if not only for us, but also the people we care about. STFU with lying azz conspiracy theories and leave us alone.
0	Take the vaccine then the real health problems begin. These sheep never learn.
1	Take your boosters and take them often.
0	Take your shot and deal with it's side effects, why are so many willing to take it when they don't know anything about it? and if you die or have side effects they aren't liable...You forgot to mention the chip to verify you have gotten it.
1	Take your vaccines, they will protect you
1	Taking the vaccine and having bad side effects far outweighs catching the virus and falling ill.
1	Taking the vaccine will safe people
0	Tell that to the people who have died from the vaccine.
1	Tens of thousands of people die yearly from medical mistakes and drug reactions but people afraid of vaccines
1	Than you Pfizer for your vaccine. Please make a booster so that we're protected from these other variants.
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children.
1	Thank You for giving me a clear understanding. I, who was not very convinced with this vaccine idea, now have a change of mind. I'm getting vaccine tomorrow.
1	Thank god its working
1	Thank you ,Doctor. You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
1	Thank you Darwin for weeding out these stupid selfish people who don't get vaccinated. They threaten all the rest of us.
1	Thank you Moderna!!
1	Thank you Pfizer for your tireless effort and determination to help the whole world.
1	Thank you baby Jesus for the mRNA vaccines
1	Thank you for destroying antivaxxers and covidiots with logic and scientifical evidences. To be honest, I feel so impressed on how scientists and experts can develop vaccine for COVID-19 faster than ever, thanks to medical science and technology that advanced farther.
1	Thank you for explaining this to normal person, I’m more understand of efficiency of vaccines now
1	Thank you for making this video to clear up the misconceptions people may have! Im from Texas, USA, and a lot of healthcare workers have been administered their first dose (yay)!!!
0	Thank you for posting this. I was scheduled to get a vaccine this afternoon but after seeing your video I immediately canceled. I will share this with everyone I can so they too can understand why they should never take this snake oil.
0	Thank you for sharing this info. I had Covid 4 months ago but at risk of losing my job on Jan.4th if I’m not fully vaccinated. I wish people would demand government to look at natural immunity & stop with vaccine mandates!!
0	Thank you for standing your ground. We unvaccinated agree that we do have a right to what goes into our body’s. Once it’s in, there’s no way you can get it out. No way to undo a potential harm. And guess what, vax want you to get vax, but if there’s something medically wrong after - then you’re in your own! And there’s no one but who who has to live within your own skin! You suffer alone
1	Thank you for the information I got my first shot yesterday (Pfizer) and I feel like total crap lol. I did have COVID and it was way worse than this.
1	Thank you for the vaccines
1	Thank you for this I'd done some basic reading after get my shot but this helped put everything into perspective
1	Thank you for your vaccine. I was able to visit my 98 y.o. grandma for the first time in 18 months.
1	Thank you so much for trying to keep us safe. I have had my bivalent booster. At 76 I do all I can to stay safe.
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine... I appreciate the explanation ...
1	Thanks I really needed this because I haven’t been able to see my grand parents so I finally will
1	Thanks a lot for this video. I got a shot two times with Biontech/Pfizer, but my husband got one shot of Johnon & Johnson and I was worried about if this was enough to keep him healthy. Now I'm much more confident.
1	Thanks for creating this video! There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
0	Thanks for sharing. And many ridiculed those who did not get vaxxed. The trials/efficacy were skewed all along. Who do we trust? Hold the CDC accountable!!
1	Thanks so much, for the info on vaccines.
1	Thanks to both of you for the great information. Where can I find more information about getting vaccinated in my state? Az
1	Thanks to vaccine million Life was safe
0	Thanks, I have change my mind seeing your video. I will not have the JAB, you have convinced me ;)
0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous.
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist!
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist! And thanks vox for explaining it so well so easy to understand
1	That second dose really surprised me I was ready for the worst pain and side effects but it was not as bad as the first for me, except for a sore arm and fatigue that went away with an extra nap the second day I was quite happy.
0	That shit don’t work. Gave some of my family and friends new health issues! Not worth the long term affects.
1	That shot was so quick and smooth
0	That the spike protein is “harmless” is highly debatable.
1	That woman crying over kids being vaccinated was the most ridiculous thing. Children having their rights taken away? Like they already had rights in that area to begin with! Parents are legally able to make all medical decisions for children. So if a kid wants a vaccine but their parent won’t do it, they’re shit out of luck. I hope she never becomes a nurse. She’s clearly not learned anything.
0	That's a no from me dawg.
0	That’s odd. Yet there’s been how many deaths of healthy young people after receiving mRNA vaccines, but they claim- nothing to see here
0	The COVID vaccines destroy the hearts of young kids. Literally. And now there are autopsy reports to prove it.
1	The Covid vaccinations, masks and washing your hands are great tools to fight this virus. Also helps mitigate flu transmission from person to person.
0	The Covid vaccine is basically that medicine that does more damage than it fixes
0	The Covid vaccines are not safe & are a nightmare we can't wake up from
1	The Covid-19 Vaccine safe life thanks god it came out
0	The Pfizer vaccine has never been approved for use in humans, and was granted only emergency authorization. Pfizer would only agree if they could not be sued. The safety trials are still ongoing, they are lying by omission.
1	The Vaccine Might Make You Drowsy For A Day But Save Your Life.
1	The anti vaxxers are stuck In a dangerous cult. It's a hard one who will I listen to a medical doctor with years of experience or someone with no medical training. Yeah sure a small number of people can have adverse reactions it's sad but this is a tiny percentage. Vaccines have saved so many lifes.
1	The anti vaxxers have done a splendid job of poisoning gullible people’s minds concerning any vaccines.
1	The anti-vaccine movement needs to let their insurance company know. When they catch COVID and get hospitalized, they will pay their own bill!
0	The best thing about resisting is not having to worry about SADS
1	The best vaccine right now is the one you’re offered
0	The big pharma insisting on having no liability is enough for me to say HELL NO!!
1	The biggest Vaccine side effect is that you might just live long enough to experience your first breakup
0	The bigiest lie in history
0	The conspiracy is that the government gave Pfizer billions of dollars to make vaccines that don’t work, and are continuing to pretend that they do work in order to save face.
0	The country has lost its damn mind. Do not get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine while you're pregnant. Just because a doc says it's OK doesn't mean it is. Look at all the thalidomide babies! Good lord.
0	The day I trust CNN for news is the same day I'll trust Pfizer toxins injected in my blood. Controlled media puppets.
1	The delta variant has a 1,260 times more transmissable rate than the original covid 19 virus. Therefore there is more likelihood of more infections. Vaccination with 2 doses has shown to be an effective barrier against a severe case of covid.
0	The doctor does not have to justify why she hasn't had a vaccine to anyone...and neither do I!
0	The fact it became available within a year is terrifying. Probably going to do more harm than good.
0	The fact that Big Tech and Gov and Pharma along with Tik Tok nurses have combined forces to shame the world into taking this cocktail is enough reason to run from it
0	The fact that can use the logic of “this is a extremely rare side effect” and still force the vaccine but cant use the same logic of its extremely rare for me to die of covid regardless if I’m vaccinated is really aggravating
0	The fact that the producers aren't liable for any damages including injury and death says it all to me. How tf is it so hard to grasp?
0	The fact the government has to keep using various methods to convince us that the vaccine is safe to take makes me never want to touch the damn thing
0	The fact you are unable to sue the company’s if damages Happen is all I need to know
1	The fastest way out of this pandemic is through mass vaccination. This INCLUDES children. We can't vaccinate children without safety data - & to do that we need children in trials. If you have an adolescent interested - here's info about Moderna's trial.
0	The four types of vaccine are: 1.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 2.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 3.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 4.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one.
0	The government doesn’t not have the authority to legislate anything that violates our god given rights!
0	The government dont give AF about any of us!! All this is so fishy that its scary!
1	The infection rate is 30k ish a day. Our vaccination is 20x better. Eat that COVID!
0	The ingredients wouldn't help a fly get better it's all nasty stuff why would anyone think those ingredients would keep you immunized it's ridiculous it's like the emperor's new clothes
1	The messed up thing was during this time frame alot of people like myself were so overwhelmed at work that we had no time to do anything but work and sleep. We didn't even get lunch breaks. Thankfully alot of the craziness in retail had slowed down and I have since been able to get vaccinated
0	The money from the Vaccine has sure saved their family, it just dosen't prevent infection, or really do anything else.
0	The monsters pushing this poison are murderers.
1	The more people who are vaccinated, the more lives will be saved and the less the virus is in circulating the lower the chance of variants developing. It is right and sensible to take up the offer.
0	The more they try to convince me to get it the more my gut tells me not too
1	The most common side effect of the COVID vaccine is not dying of COVID
1	The myocarditis associated with the Covid 19 vaccine is mild and recoverable. You know what causes deadly myocarditis? The SARS Co-V2 virus itself. Thanks, I’ll take the vaccine. My cardiologist highly recommended it, and he’s the best in my state.
1	The new classical vaccines ( without mRNA and graphen) function perfectly as boosters so e.g. Novavax, without devastating side effects.
0	The new vaccine for COVID-19 will be the first of its kind EVER. It will be an mRNA vaccine which will literally alter your DNA.
0	The point is you can get infected and recover without a vaccine, so why should I take it when there are no guarantees both ways?
1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research. Thanks for this video
0	The right to control what enters your body is absolutely and unquestionably a basic human right.
0	The same people who have gaslighted and lied to us all these years are now pushing this rushed vaccine HARD. I’ll take my chances with the 99% survival rate of covid
0	The same people willing to take the Vaccine are the same people that will only buy organic foods because they don't trust the foods that agencies like the FDA and USDA or basically the government says are perfectly safe to eat with the GMO's ,artificial fillers, antibiotics , etc but now believe anything the government tells them?
0	The scary part is that now, if you’re up to date. There’s absolutely nothing you can do to remove it from your body. Expect incoming reports to keep you up at night.
0	The shot would make me sicker than what COVID could do.
0	The unscientific, unethical, unconstitutional COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers was predicated on lies which I exposed on the House floor. The House will vote to end this mandate today.
0	The unvaccinated are doing great
0	The unvacinated will survive
0	The vaccine brain damage has already got these people.
1	The vaccine has a low probability of side effects
0	The vaccine is a gateway to treatments more controversial...genetic instructions...Yay!
0	The vaccine is definitely some kind of thing to destroy the population
1	The vaccine is effective against the covid19
0	The vaccine is not safe, and is not approved. They are pushing for such quick fda approval because they want to silence this argument. Only reason.
1	The vaccine is safe... study the ingredients, do research on the ingredients
1	The vaccine is working well
0	The vaccine kills people.
0	The vaccine sounds more scary than the virus
0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.
0	The vaccine will be the real virus...
0	The virus is fake. The hospitals are empty. The doctors' surgeries are empty. The test centres are empty. The scamdemic is a fraud. Resist fascism!
1	The woman at the beginning saying because of her personal experience she is anti vaccines is like a person getting into a car accident and then being anti-cars.
1	The worst part is the anti-vaxxers.
0	The 💉 is experimental. Good luck sheep
0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK
0	There is evidence that it has saved 10s of thousands of lives??? I dont think so!!
1	There is extremely little risk to the vaccine. We know this and it's been reported on accurately. There is some unidentifiable greater risk to getting COVID based solely on the existence of long COVID, even if it's less common than you think. The risk/reward is very easy.
1	There is no excuse for not getting vaccinated.
0	There is no reason to take it anymore stop pushing unproven crap so some people can make a buck
0	There was a reason why vaccine manufacturers disclaimed that they bear no liability to serious side effects from their vaccines. We are now promptly seeing this reason.
0	There's nothing wrong with not wanting to have an injection, we don't need, and don't know is safe.
0	Theres a reason why we are hesitant. My reason, we are seeing larger groups of people with vaccine side effects that the mainstream media doesnt talk about. The silence on this is disturbing especially because itz getting worse.
0	These are not vaccines in a traditional sense. They are playing with your genes.
1	These parents should be forced to home school their children. These parents have No right to endanger the infant and children population of an entire state. This isn't a personal freedom issue it's a public safety issue!!
0	These two men, I don’t believe not one word they tell us. These two men are way to scripted, way to excited and way to happy about the vaccines.
0	These words these diagrams/drawings...trial stages....two shots...what?! Naah, can't trust y'all*
0	They (young people) don’t need it as it doesn’t affect the young.
0	They are getting really pushy - how many times do people have to say "NO".
0	They are pushing this to hard.... And when you see doctor and health care workers not getting it..... This entire thing has me thinking something not right
0	They are safe for no one
0	They can keep their needle. No thanks.
1	They know the vaccine is safe already. They had to trash its reputation in order to stop demand for something they simply do not have due to their useless preparations.
1	They need to focus on vaccinate everyone above 55 like ASAP. Even in third world countries bc that thing keeps goin around around and who knows wth is gonna turn into. And old ppl are the most at risk, once theyre vaccinated they can give it to younger ppl and get that virus under control.
1	They save way more lives than they take. Why rely on natural immunity when your natural immunity may not be enough? Vaccines don't replace your immune system, they supplement it.
1	They should be vaccinated to be safe from COVID
0	They’re going to blame the vaccine side effects on other “covid variants” meanwhile everyone will be dying off by their own stupidity for taking the vaccine. Don’t be fooled.
0	This confirmed my decision I made a while ago...I'm not taking
0	This could be the greatest crime in history…they new about these chronic side effects & lied to us.
0	This does not increase my confidence in covid vaccines at all.
0	This is 80% fact 20% plain wrong, and also pushes the plain unknown with total confidence, I recomend you look at the numbers in the uk of deaths from covid after vaccination, from start feb, to aug 8th 2021 the deaths of people vaccinated outnumber those not!!!! DONT BELIEVE ME LOOK YOURSELF,
1	This is by far the best news since the vaccine came out imo. Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
1	This is good news regarding the Covid vaccine for kids. Note myocarditis is more prominent in unvaccinated kids who get Covid.
1	This is good news! I can see this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic. Hopefully, this virus will be completely eradicated by next year including the new variant.
1	This is incredibly reassuring. My sister and her boyfriend both just got J&J and I was a bit concerned for them, that they wouldn't be as protected as me or other people who got Pfizer or moderna.
0	This is like someone jumping into a giant fire pit and then screaming to others, “come on in, the fire is nice!“
1	This is objectively very fucking good.
1	This is probably THE best video debunking anti-vax claims. While the first one isn't quite well after Pfizer got approved last month, it still holds pretty strong so thanks!
1	This is smart and I just got my vaccine today
0	This is the begining of their NEW WORLD ORDER, reset the people's genetic material through the vaccine.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus... omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic🖤
0	This is the mark of the beast. Those who don't get it will suffer but not as much as those who do get it.
1	This is too much science for anti-vaxers.
0	This is truly horrifying. Your covid vaccine was never meant to be safe, or effective!
1	This is what we need to play in schools. Educate the safety of vaccines to kids.
1	This is what you call proper explanation of the vaccine efficacy statistics.
0	This is why it is better by far to go through proper extended testing instead of rushing in to mass vaccination.
1	This kind of educational videos about the vaccines should be aired all over the world and over mass media so that we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
1	This made me feel so much better, honestly the vaccine is the way to go. If you want this to end, take the vaccine ladies and gentlemen!
1	This should be required viewing for every person who doesn't want to take it because they think the vaccine (for Covid19) is a hoax
0	This vaccine is affecting my health in various ways I never felt fever in my life but after this vaccine.
0	This vaccine is neither safe nor effective. Obviously. The deaths have risen after the vaccine came out. Most of the sick and dying are vaccinated right now. Gaslighting is exactly what the government & media has done to us all for the past few years. The greatest harm to us all- no trust anymore in the media or government. The damage to this country by corrupt politicians and government officials should create a real reaction from us all to remain united & demand justice. Be smart and follow science, the real science not the bought & paid for corrupt science.
0	This vaccine was quickly pushed through without knowing the long term effects or short term effects.This is a big no no .
1	This video is great. I wish though that the vaccine strategy takes into account the debilitating effects of long COVID, people like me who had almost no initial symptoms and now with a potential life sentence. Vaccine is better than no vaccine, but simply "de-fang" is not enough when an estimated 1/3 of infected will get long COVID.
0	Those of us that refused to listen to the mask propaganda and do independent research and again were rightfully skeptical towards an experimental jab went through a very strange hazing from such a majority of society. Unlike anything I’ve ever seen in this country. I’m glad me and my family stood on our morals and own unbiased research!!!
0	Those of us who stood our ground and refused the mystery oil have no regrets.
0	Those that choose not to get vaccinated are actually people with brains and can think for themselves. It's not about covid.
0	Those were not intelligent people because they did not give valid facts or good reasons why they're not interested. My reason is simple ( the shot has things in it that disrupt the immune system ) , plus I have an immune system thats strong and works. ( Sunday April 4rth 2021 Happy Resurrection DAY )
0	Those who take the vaccine will face problems in the future and rue the day they did not have the courage to say NO.
0	Thumbs DOWN.......DONT TAKE IT...
0	To make a long story short: It kills you, starting with you insides.
1	To the people scared of needles, I got my last vaccination a while ago! Neither of them hurt, you can feel a pinch and after that you can’t even notice the needle is in your arm! My arm hurt and I had a slight headache about a day or two after, but it’s definitely not nearly as bad as Covid!
0	Today I stopped my monthly donation to Unicef. I don't want to support your vaccination program for Covid-19! Instead, use the money for things people need- like food, building homes, clean water etc.
1	Today is my birthday and I couldn’t have asked for a better gift then to break all these vaccine records, awesome news!
0	Too much is not known about covid-19. This shot is too new.
1	Took mine no side effects at all just arm was a little sore
1	Took my first dose today in Illinois, feeling good!
1	Took my first part of the vaccine, didn't feel a thing...
0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years. I understand we can't do that right now. But who knows what it's going to show long-term
1	Trump lies even when the truth will do. The tens of thousands of lies he has told that his adoring followers believe (a fair share of those lies being about COVID-19) has so polluted the Republican Party that it has morphed into America's Fifth Column. The reluctance by his followers to get vaccinated is based on lies told by him and other Republican politicians, and not only puts all of us at risk, but all of the world's population at risk. Moreover, there has been evidence that mammalian animal species such as cats (big and small), dogs and minks can be infected with COVID-19, aka SARS-CoV-2. While these animals currently do not seem to become seriously ill or even to die the possibility exists that they could become reservoirs or vectors of the virus that they could then pass on, possibly as a lethal variant, back to humans. Mississippi, wake up! America, wake up! Get vaccinated!
1	UNICEF you are doing and distributing vaccines booster COVID-19 make for more confident and safe for people.Thank you so much.
0	Ummm, I'll pass on that. I'll wait until these politicians and celebrities shows how effective it is. It seems like the side effects is worst than Covid-19 itself
1	Unvaccinated kids are just speedrunning life
1	Unvaccinated people over 65 in the US had a 52x higher rate of hospitalization from Covid in December than people in the same age group who were up-to-date with their vaccination. Get vaccinated and boosted!
0	Useless vaccine , Nothing more than business
1	Vacations are wonderful.
1	Vaccinate the working population first and the teachers get the kids back to school and the people back to work it makes more sense before we all die from starvation
1	Vaccinated and not infected yet. Fingers crossed!
1	Vaccination is a human right .
1	Vaccination is great way to build our immunity. It's a only one way to fight against corona virus. Make sure to protect our society
0	Vaccine and illuminate sign this vaccine is number 666 sign that if you have no this vaccine 666 you can't buy a sell Satan program. Don't agree this .
0	Vaccine are poison!
0	Vaccine injuries have numbered in the millions.
0	Vaccine is a useless product, causing major risk factors
0	Vaccine is not an appropriate word. The word is experimental. Please do your research before deciding to have an EXPERIMENTAL AGENT injected into your body. Stay safe.
0	Vaccine is to control the world population not stop covid had nothing to do with covid
0	Vaccine justice seems like stealing freedom to me
1	Vaccines and medications aren’t destroying humanity, no — it’s the anti-vaxxer community’s complete ignorance and misinformation that’s destroying humanity from being able to save itself.
1	Vaccines are especially important for people at increased risk, such as people with chronic lung diseases and those who are immunocompromised. The best way to protect yourself and vulnerable family members from severe COVID-19 is to get vaccinated.
1	Vaccines are inherently good
1	Vaccines are our best tool in the fight against COVID-19. If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated and get boosted.
1	Vaccines are really good for you.
1	Vaccines are such a human achievement. The more i learn about them the more im impressed
1	Vaccines are wonderful. However, I will wait a bit before getting this one. Many different vaccines for COVID-19 and Astra Zeneca one has been halted.
1	Vaccines can have a certain effect
1	Vaccines can help to improve your immunity
1	Vaccines can't fight COVID-19 when people are unwilling to take them.
1	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk.
0	Vaccines do not cause autism. Sure. I have autistic daughter. When she was 8 month she was vaccinated (6in1). Next day she got fever, she got normal after 3-4 days. But after 2 weeks she stopped to laugh, look in the eyes and play with her toys. She became quiet, kind of thinking inside. Now she's 10 yo. She can't talk and shows typical autism symptoms. I've done her hair analysis and it clearly showed that after vaccination the level of aluminium in her body raised multiple times above secure levels. Continue to lie.
1	Vaccines do not cause autism. This whole narrative is so totally batshit crazy that I can’t even imagine who thinks this should be publicised.
0	Vaccines have harmful ingredients such as baby cells, mercury, and so on. It’s not meant to reside in a humans body
0	Vaccines have never been Double Blind Placebo tested. WHY? The only pharmaceutical used on mass where this is the case. WHY?
1	Vaccines help boost immunity
1	Vaccines protect against covid
1	Vaccines r a no brainer, protect yourself and others.
1	Vaccines save lives! Please don't hesitate to be a part of this universal fight against #COVID19
1	Vaccines save lives.
0	Vaccines usually take a decade or more of research. No one knows what the side effects may be of an expedited vaccine. I’m pro-vaccination but not for one that was pushed through research.
1	Vaccines work…and I am absolutely pro-vaccine
0	Vacination is NOT the best way.... Heathy diet Vitamin C, D3 and Zinc is the way out..... WHO you said one can still be infected with the virus even if you get the jab. So why should people take d jab..the only reason there is push for d vaccines is selfish interest of few men who want to control the world
0	Vacination is a genocide.
1	Very rare 1:100,000 to 1:600,000 risk of clots with vaccine
1	Very well said as the proper treatment will save the lives of millions of people.
0	Vitamin D. Zinc. Vitamin C and others are the way for me.
0	WAKE UP!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH!!! BEING SICK IS A BUSINESS $$$$
1	WELL THANK GOD FOR THIS VACCINE
0	WORD OF THE LORD: DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY BECOME ZOMBIES WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS!!! Pray and confirm before you mock and scoff!
1	Was finally able to get my first dose Wednesday, feeling good no side effects
1	Watching this after getting my first dose of Moderna Vaccine!
1	We are all in this together you good little citizens!
0	We are good here in Africa, don't bring your immune destroyer here. What happened to the American senator that took the vaccine yet test positive to covid19 ?
0	We are just guinea pigs. This is what you get when you put murdered baby material into people's arms.
0	We as the people need to fight back by not taking it n if they try to force it that means war time
1	We can do it! I'm literally sitting in the waiting area after getting my first shot right now!
0	We don't need a "vaccine" for something with a 98% survival rate!
0	We have all had some vaccines throughout our lives yet none of them left us bedridden for two days with uncontrollable chills and 102 fever that is not normal I am sorry
0	We have no idea what all is in it. Can't trust them for the truth.
1	We have the tools we need to protect ourselves from severe COVID. Please get your free COVID-19 vaccine and booster. It could save your life or someone you love.
1	We must get the children vaccinated so we can get back to normal
0	We need to STOP calling these things "side-effects" !!!!! They ARE EFFECTS !!!!!!!
1	We need to educate people about vaccination. Even my parents refused to be vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson because of its "efficacy rate"
1	We weren't asked to go to war and sacrifice our lives. We were asked to protect ourselves, protect the vulnerable and get a needle. Pretty easy decision for me. Triple vaxxed and proud to be part of a loving, caring society.
0	Well I WONT BE GETTING ANY BLOODY Needle, there is no way this is ready for release , it's still mutating .
0	Well I like the fact that my immune system already had an adaptive response to Covid-19. How cool is that.
1	Well done for taking part in a trial. It’s thanks to people like you the vaccines were ready for all of us.
1	Well you've got more chance of catching Covid and developing severe blood clots from that than you do from any vaccine. FACT.
1	What I truly don’t understand is that if you don’t believe the medical profession regarding their opinion on Covid and the vaccine then why bother going to medical professionals to get better? I feel for the health care workers. My heart goes out to them.
1	What a convenient timing, I’m getting my vaccine today, this helped me feel a lot more excited Update: just got my first shot and I’m feeling great! Thank you Ted for sharing this important message and I wish everyone a great day, except for the anti vax people commenting here. Stay safe!
0	What about sudden deaths after the jabs Mr Faucci.
0	What about the risk of vaccine injury for this experimental drug. The real numbers of adverse reactions are being covered up.
0	What happened to the theory of Survival of the Fittest?! I think we should let nature take its course, and the pharmaceutical firms to stop making money!!!!
0	What if the Covid vaccine really is giving us a third strand of DNA?
0	What people justice to choose for themselves what goes in their bodies ,alyo need to leave people alone
0	What really is important are parents that are wise enough not to subject their children to such "treatments"
1	What we need to do is send the vaccines that are being left out to countries in need.
1	What's frustrating is if I sent this video to the anti covid vaxxers I know they would disregard it claiming is brain washing or you are just plain wrong, or you are lying for some reason. I ask them what the difference is when they send me their informational videos? They claim their information is right, I ask how they know that. And that is usually when they stop replying to me or they send me another link.
0	When some of these vaccines only have 60% effective and they do not protect against strains they are not meant for. Not getting one.
0	When the most evil people on the planet are telling you to be a good neighbor and get a "safe" vaccine, run like a kid who's just been offered a lollipop from a strange man in a van!
0	When the truth finally comes out, you can’t unvaxx your kids.
0	When they can get together to vaccinate the entire world's population, but can't arrange to feed the starving, it's proof that this is not about health or 'saving lives'.
0	When they told you the vaccine worked - then claimed in the same breath that the unvaccinated were a danger to the vaccinated … common sense should’ve immediately told you this made zero sense and it was time to start questioning everything.
0	When trial research results are sealed from the public for 70 years; that’s all I need to know on “patient safety.”
0	When you eat something it is mandatory to have the ingredients on the label when you get a vaccine questioning what the ingrdience is taboo because if you understood you would never agree to injecting poison into your body
1	Who else DIDN’T suffer severe side effects from getting the COVID vaccine?
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
0	Who else is packing up for this zombie apocalypse
0	Who here knows someone who has suffered from adverse COVID-19 vaccine side effects?
1	Why are people anti-vaxxers? I don’t get it
0	Why are people taking a experimental vaccine, for a virus with a 99% survival rate?
1	Why are vaccines important? In 2020, vaccines prevent more than 1.2m deaths globally. An additional 2 million child deaths could be prevented each year through immunization with currently available vaccines. Stay away from #misinformation and #GetVaccinated #StaySafe
1	Why do people keep saying the COVID vaccines are untested? They were tested and followed extremely closely throughout the entire global community with public results.
0	Why do you have to explain this over and over is it even worth it? Here in Zimbabwe we are using natural remedies and have proven effective so far so good
0	Why don't they aspirate the injection, there is always a little risk it can get into the bloodstream.
0	Why don't you properly test these drugs first ffs?!
0	Why get a vaccine when it is proven that you can get the virus again even after the vaccine. I would rather get the virus again and not get a dirty old vaccine.
0	Why get the vaccine if you can still get COVID if you get it??
0	Why in bloody hell world anyone want to take this vaccine when you've got a better then 99% chance of not dying
0	Why is the vaccine wait the zombies is there gonna be zombies
0	Why not speak about the long term affects of all the covid vaccines? Because nobody knows for sure
0	Why should big pharma make all the money?
0	Why the fuck are people still calling these poison shots vaccines
0	Why would I put something in my body when I don’t even know what’s in it?
0	Why would a healthy fit person need to take it of whatever age when it has been created in less than 8 months not knowing long term side effects.
0	Why would u ever let urself be vaccinated
0	Why would you need a vaccine when you have a 99.9% chance of surviving covid in the first place
0	Why would young healthy people get a vaccination for a virus with a 98% survival rate?
1	Wife and I received our pfizer today, and nothing but a sore arm.
0	Will I take this vaccine, let me think for a minute, NOOOOOOOO
0	Without a doubt, if it happened to him it can happen to me. I am sure he never thought he'd have adverse side effects before getting vaxed, but he did. Until we learn more about WHY some get adverse effects while others don't, I will remain unvaxed
1	Woohoo! Just got home from getting my second shot (Pfizer)
0	Worried about side effects in the future
1	Would have loved it more if it had dedicated more explaining about the mRNA part, cause that’s the part antivaxxers use to spread fear.
0	Wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't.
0	Wow, I wonder why, so many cases of died suddenly happened.
1	Wow, mind blowing. I was vaccinated and boosted. I got covid this week. I’ve been pretty sick the last few days BUT if I weren’t vaccinated I would be in much worse shape. I have asthma and my breathing is FINE. I have had chills, headache, fatigue, runny nose, cough and sore throat. It’s not easy but I don’t think I’d be recovering at home if I didn’t get vaccinated. I’d be in a hospital
0	Y'all can have my doses. Enjoy........
0	Y'all stupid if u think I'm a take a vaccine
1	YAY SCIENCE!
1	YES literally couldn't get signed up fast enough once it opened up to me. I did it to protect myself, others, and the baby that was growing inside me at that time
0	YOU CANNOT FORCE ANYONE TO GET THE COVID VACCINE ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS WILL BE SUED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW AND THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY!
0	YOU'RE LYING THE VAX IS KILLING HEALTHY PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IT.
0	Ya know anybody who gets this thing is just straight up brainwashed
1	Yay! I get the J&J Tuesday! Can’t wait!!!
0	Yea right, no one knows the effects of this new vaccine product, long term especially. The world is the project.
1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.
1	Yeah no shit. And those of us who work in Healthcare are beyond frustrated that we have to deal with these morons who refuse to get vaccinated and are now taking up a large chunk of our hospital beds and resources. My hospital for the past few weeks has had about an 8 hour ER wait because we are getting so many COVID patients coming in with shortness of breath. Surprise surprise when we find out they aren't vaccinated. Fuck all these idiots.
0	Yeah passing on all of it.
1	Yeah, it's really difficult to choose between trusting a doctor with several years of studies and a Karen that googles things and spreads misinformation on Facebook
0	Yeah, right! No thanks!
0	Yeah, why would anyone stop taking a medication that isn't helping their problem and causes debilitating side effects? So baffling.
0	Yeah...I'll be fine without the satanic shot.
1	Yes Vaccine is "LIFE SAVING" Thank you.
1	Yes! Everyone associated with healthcare needs to be vaccinated. Thank you.
1	Yes, please let the public know that our scientists and medical professionals are working hard for the good of the people! ALL PEOPLE!!
1	Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes. You may have a sore arm and fatigue for a few days and that's very likely it. Get the vaccine.
1	Yet again… more evidence that vaccines help to keep people out of the hospital. How much more data do people need to finally understand?
0	You are corrupt chemical killers
0	You call it side effects, I call it direct effects. No poison in my body!
0	You can expect blood clots
0	You couldn't pay me to take that poison
0	You don't have to be an "antivaxxer" to understand the stupidity this year
0	You don't need to be vaccinated against a virus with a 99% recovery rate!
0	You don't need to take a vaccine for the measles all you have to do is treat it my family we all had measles as kids we didn't go to the doctor to have a shot for the measles all we did is get some calamine lotion put it on took care of the itching and after so many days the virus was gone two weeks and I was back in school
0	You don’t most likely it’s just another toxic chemical you’ll put into your body .. cancers aren’t natural peeps .. man made toxins do bad things to your body .. your greatest hope is cancer shows it’s face at about 80 years old when your at the end anyhow
0	You don’t think the vaccine can harm you? I bet people that have gotten myocarditis from it would disagree
1	You guys are ok to be a little scared, it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine.
0	You have to sign a waiver before you take it saying that you won't blame the government or the medical office if something goes bad or you get deathly ill from it. But yeah, seems pretty safe to me.
0	You just won the jackpot of one million blood clots. Congratulations.
1	You know right now we really need a covid vaccine right now
0	You need a vaccine for something that you have a 1% chance of getting? And a 99% chance of full recovery?
1	You probably have the unrealistic expectation that a vaccine must be 100% effective and 100.000% risk free or it's completely useless.
0	You should expect some mild symptoms, small chance of being permanently injured, and small chance of dying, followed by the chance of still being able to get Contrick-19.
1	You should make vaccines As early as you can
0	You shouldn’t trust the vaccine! It kills people!
0	You won’t know what it’s done to your body for years to come
1	Your refusal to get vaccinated has landed my cousin in the hospital with what doctors can only assume is Invisible Asymptomatic Very Long Covid (AVLC). This is hard to treat and requires round-the-clock care.
1	Your risk of health complications is overwhelmingly higher in every age group if you don’t get vaccinated than if you do. This is scientifically accurate information.
1	You’d be hard pressed to find anywhere close to 80 Canadian deaths of any persons that could be linked to the vaccines. The vaccines are safe and they work.
0	Yup, and i still got no covid vaccine to date. No matter how many times my doctor pushes it.
1	Yup. By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
1	a similar vaccine, had a similar case during clinical trials
0	a vax for flu & colds is a profit making venture not a humanitarian effort ..
1	absolutely ingenious! those who had the mind to manipulate mRNA in such a way deserve respect.
0	admit that it was a disaster harmuf and lethal harmful and lethal harmful and lethal
1	all the dislikes are anti survivers
1	all the people scared of a VACCINE in the comments are pathetic. id rather be injected with a faulty vaccine than be infected with a disease that KILLS PEOPLE
1	am.full support of the vaccine I we always against those people that says bad thing about the vaccine
0	and now they want to vaccinate the entire world with their covid vaccine and ignoring all these adverse reactions from these other vaccines to our children!
1	anti-vaxers are such complete morons.
1	astrazeneca and sinovac are the only vaccines available in my country so i was kind of skeptical. but now im glad im going to get vaccinated!
1	avoiding all vaccines because you had a bad reaction... is like avoiding all fruit because you ended up being allergic to apples...
1	basically if you get side effects from the vaccine it means it's working. I wish people can understand this.
0	certain false behaviors in the promotion of vaccines
0	continue with the testing and ensure it's safe before distribution
0	count me in too. im now an antivaxxer.
0	don't take their vaccines, do your own research please people. information is being silenced
1	don’t feel bad after the vaccine
0	drug that doesn't have any long-term test results
1	feel better being protected
1	feel good after injecting

1	got my first dose of pfizer yesterday. been feeling like shit for a while now. but glad i got one
1	have been vaccinated and think it’s not bad
1	help to get antibodies
0	herd immunity will come
1	here in Portugal with an almost 100% vaccine rate, mask-wearing *out of respect for others has worked amazingly... I am triple vaxed. no health issues and no problems... I'm SO glad Portugal handled this way.It had nothing to do with freedoms, just common sense and an attitude of caring for each other.
1	hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them.
1	i don’t care how long it lasts, if i need to get another dose next week, i’ll be the first in line!
1	i finally realised why i was sick for 2 weeks after getting the needles in me. it's to build memory cell so in the future i don't get sick easily and fight off bacteria faster.
1	i got hit by covid x2 and after vaccines are available in our country i never had a second thought and told our medical professionals "here's my arm. hit me hard " 😆
1	i got my Pfizer second dose yesterday!
1	i have asthma, and i’m really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	i live in NH. my doctor tried talking me into the vaccine today i’m pregnant... they have no studies on how that would effect the baby or me 😂 she goes well we think it’s safe. y’all also thought the polio vaccine was safe and look how that worked out.
1	i love how the lady in the beginning said she had family members injured by vaccines but never gave any proof or even explained it at all
0	i love how they leave out the fact these trails are expected to be finished by 2023 and none of these vaccines are FDA approved
0	i was anti vaxxed and i have not gotten sick for 3 years before and how are wild animals ok if they were not vaccinated?
1	i was down for 2 whole days after second vaccine. at that time i was in bad shape, and i was happy i got it. if i got the real infection , it would have been much much worse. so better to suffer for 2 days than in breathing help machine for months.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated!
1	i've had 2 shots. no reaction at all the 2nd time. makes me wonder if i need to get another shot later this year. like, in the fall or late summer.
0	if they're saying that we are too many on the planet., can you really trust these people coming up with a vaccine from a man made virus?
1	if we hadn't treated covid as a political issue instead of the health issue it really is, we really would've gotten a lot more done by now
1	if you assume it is from the vaccine then you must assume also that the Wild virus COVID 19 itself, especially if you catch it unvaccinated, would've got you more cardiovascular complications/ severely ill. Consultation and following with a cardiologist would be the best thing to do in you case. But not to stay unprotected/ unvaccinated, especially if you are experiencing cardiovascular problem. It might be coincidental, there might be even family history for heart conditions. It might be a mild complication as you got COVID itself while being vaccinated (as I mentioned), so please try not to jump into conclusions Instead seek professional advice, there are certain heart condition that favor a type of vaccine over the other and a good physician will tell you if it is advisable or not and when to take a booster vaccine. Just stay informed through a physician/ cardiologist
0	if you’re smart enough and have a clear mindset, you won’t get vaccinated. if you wanna play russian roulette have fun and take it.

0	shutting down the whole world for a year or more because of the virus, making people aware of danger to avoid in any way possible catching it, and now urging and encouraging them to put it in the body? where's the logic?

1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
1	well airforce gave me my Pfizer shot today all is good just sore at the injection site. Im alive and well
1	well, my 102 year old Omi(grandma), has all the shots and she's doing great.. but I guess when she goes, we'll know it's the shots!

1	“No vaccine has ever been proven effective.” That’s right, I guess that’s why there’s still a huge epidemic of Polio.
0	“We cannot have normality until everyone globally has been vaccinated.” Bill Gates Psychopath
