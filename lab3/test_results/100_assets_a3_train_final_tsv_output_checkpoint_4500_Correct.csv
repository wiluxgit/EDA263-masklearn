21,no vaccine ever. you will not inject something i don‚Äôt want in my body,0,0
22,what if the covid vaccine really is giving us a third strand of dna?,0,0
23,"i think the main reason is people are starting to realize these vaccines don‚Äôt work and all they are doing is making a bunch of criminals richer. these vaccines have been killing people, and this isn‚Äôt conspiracy theorists talking, the data is all there for anyone to see. the cdc has seen the data and they don‚Äôt care. they are more interested in keeping this money making machine going.",0,0

39,if it's going to take years anyway would it not have been better to just let it run its course?,0,0
40,i am a doctor in the u.k. i had the oxford astrazeneca vaccine. the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! all vaccines will have some degree of risk. the most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!,1,1

49,"i still see so many people say ""i feel sorry for all of these unvaccinated people. it's really tragic how they've been misled!"" at first i agreed, but at this point, they are adults who have made their decisions, and their decisions are ruining millions of people's lives. they need to be held responsible, rather than felt sorry for at this point.",1,1
50,important point! the vaccine is working. it‚Äôs not because omicron is all that mild,1,1
51,"also sitting here watching some videos on covid-19 vaccine symptoms and how it all works. it's fascinating, and the human body is just incredible! after the first shot 3 weeks ago of pfizer, all i felt was a sore arm and the next day completed a 21km spartan beast race with no adverse effects (yes, it was silly to do but i couldn't change the dates and wanted to compete), and now i'm here after the second dose yesterday morning, with very mild symptoms. my arms hurts at the injection site but only if i lift my arm and touch the area, and other than that i have a slight headache, my muscles and joints are only very slightly sore, and so far that's it!",1,1

69,"i'm 5-times unvaccinated. from what i'm reading, i'll be refusing my 6th dose very soon",0,0
71,"so far there's no sufficient evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission. me taking it won't protect someone else's life. i'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. it might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway.",0,0
72,planning on getting my vaccine shot really soon!,1,1
73,love the vaccines. i think people should be encouraged to take as many as they can hand;e and boosters when they are available this is a great channel i heard that every doctor in the uk and every person working for the nhs and government and all the mp‚Äôs have had the vaccine and they‚Äôve declared it publicly.

95,"a lot of you are alive because your parents made sure that you were vaccinated against the diseases that were killing children in the 40&50s. so what if you had a sore arm you are on the right side of the grass to complain about it. i am 81, have had my second shot no problems.",1,1
