10763,i had seizures for years due to the dpt shot as a kid. so i was hesitant when my daughter was born thankfully we have a great family doctor who acknowledged that the old dpt vaccines were not great but then explained to me how they changed since i was a kid. also he was willing to work with me so my daughter only got one vaccine at a time (not multiple like most vaccine schedules) this made me much more comfortable so i didn‚Äôt feel like her body was getting overwhelmed and gave me insurance that if there was a reaction i would know to what and we would not do the boosters to it. thankfully she has had no reaction to any of them. i could have easily been turned into an anti vaxer if i would have not had a great doctor to sit talk with me and work it out so i was comfortable with the process.....great doctors save lives.,1.0,0

13734,"i would say it is more safe than a traditional vaccine. this isn't entirely accurate an explanation but close enough: a traditional vaccine either carries a weakened or inert virus. your immune system recognizes it, and attacks it, but because it is either a weakened version nor an inert one, you don't actually get sick. now that your body knows what the invader looks like, when it sees it again it can attack it much more quickly and you don't get sick. the two methods currently available for covid vaccine take a different approach. the virus contains a specific protein that allows it to enter your cells and attack it. the vaccine has a piece of genetic code that tells your cells to create this protein. your immune system then sees that protein and attacks it. like the other approach, now when it sees the protein on the actual virus, it know how to attack it and kills the protein much quicker. without the protein, the virus is unable to infect your cells and eventually dies. so two benefits: the vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself because your immune system attacks the protein and not the virus, the virus can mutate to some degree and you will still be immune. so from what i see, this is a far superior approach and safer. the allergic reactions that are being reported seem to be related to peoples fish and egg allergies which are ingredients used in the vaccine, but i've not seen a conclusive report on this yet",1.0,0

13597,"i work in clinical trials, and i know the standard operating procedures when study drugs are put on the market. the data, and all raw data from research comes from regular people and not the pharmaceutical company. this comes from doctors, nurses, and research coordinators working in university hospitals. generally speaking, physicians do not collect and report data. this is usually someone who does not have a medical background or may. in cases as such, data is sometimes reported inaccurately. additionally, there will always be adverse events. whether it is related to covid-19 vaccine or not, adverse events will always be reported and can range from farting, knee pain, to severe dyspnea. then, a safety board monitoring panel then gets together to determine if a serious adverse event is associated with the vaccine or not. if you are hospitalized while on study, then there is a possibility that it can be associated with the vaccine. serious adverse events = related to study drug/vaccine adverse event = unlikely related to study drug point is, there is no such thing as a safe drug and not even the vaccine. the truth is, you should determine what is good for your body and what is not. i am pro-vaccine, but i am also smart enough to question whether or not something is good for me. and no, you are not a moron if you decline the vaccine. i think there is a huge witch hunt to convince someone to take something that usually takes 5 years to get approved",1.0,0
