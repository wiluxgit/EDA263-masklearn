(vaccines tell your immune system how to get ready to fight the virus or bacteria they are against. if your immune system is unable to respond, either due to a rare genetic syndrome, or more likely due to a blood cancer like leukemia or immune suppressing drugs, like chemotherapy or drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, then it is the defect in the immune system’s ability to respond, not a problem with the vaccine that caused the “failure”.) because all i really need to know that it is a at least 1000 times safer than taking my chances with covid without it!",1.0,1

27592,"the reason we can be confident is that vaccines, like most drugs, have only a very short-term effect. they aren't alive, so they can't just keep reproducing or hiding out in the body.¹ whatever they're gonna do to you (mainly trigger an immune response), they will do right away. the only long-term effect is from your immune response, because your immune system has a sort of memory system for exactly this purpose. now... if covid prevention were more like malaria prevention, or birth control, or antidepressants, where you take medication on a regular basis for years and years — then yes, of course it would be possible for long-term side effects to emerge. examples of that sort of thing are easy to find. but vaccines aren't like that. we don't take an anti-covid pill every week. it's just 1 or 2 shots, which show up in the body, do their thing, then break down and get flushed out. i don't think yours is a dumb question. it's just a question to which we happen to have a good answer. and it's not to say vaccines can't have negative and unexpected side effects. they can! but the point is, whatever it's gonna do to you, it's gonna do right away while it's in the body. with the amount of testing and scrutiny we've had for the approved covid vaccines, we can be pretty confident that we've found and quantified all the risks. anything we've missed would have to be really, really rare, like 1 case per 10 million doses or whatever. ¹there are some vaccines using a different virus as a vector to get the right stuff to the right place. so those are ""alive"" in a sense. but they picked well-known, relatively harmless viruses — adenoviruses associated with the common cold, or the like. still not something to worry about, imo, any more than we worry about the long-term side effects of catching the common cold. but maybe one more reason to prefer an mrna vaccine, since it doesn't use that trick.",1.0,1

25938,"thank you so much for this video. as someone who has reactions to other vaccines (flu, etc.), i was nervous about this one (pfizer) but i only had a immune response (and also some mild hives that i reported to v-safe). i studied the ingredients and i think it should be noted that the mrna vaccines have no preservatives, heavy metals, or antibiotics which is by far the ""cleanest"" vaccine i've had (which probably helped with no adverse events, in my case). also, since i'm a researcher in the sciences (benchwork and beyond), i already knew that the basic components disintegrate fairly fast so long-term effects from the vaccine itself is small. please mention to individuals getting the vaccine that it's wise to layoff the anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, and alcohol for about 48 hours prior to the jab to 72 hours post-jab. i know many people taking aleve, etc. a few hours before their appointment in anticipation of the effects.. we want our immune system to be full-on during the vaccine process. a little discomfort is worth it for a day or so. rarely do i hear doctors telling this sound advice. if ever we needed psas .. it's now.",1.0,1

(100% comes from the trial but such number never exists in reality so we should always consider it to be 99.9% at most). it also have been shown the sinovac vaccine protects against variants. brazil, however, used different vaccines like oxford/astrazeneca, jansen and pfizer. chile, however, afaik, used only the sinovac one and it would be interesting if dw could do a report on the chilean policy and the results they had. i have recommended friends not to allow their kids to receive dna and, more importantly, mrna vaccines. to be clear, i'm a vaccine fan - i love them - but i think these new constructs haven't been tested enough and no one can guarantee no serious long term effect will occur. i received oxford/az twice, pfizer once and jansen once - i'm almost 50 and don't consider these vaccines will have long term negative effects on me. my niece, however, who's 10, received the sinovac one. it's called coronavac here and it's basically an 1950s salk construct with dead whole viruses. my preocupation with the genetic vaccines is how much spike protein they'll produce and in the case of mrna the possible problem with the lipid capsules in relation to women's reproductive system. (to be honest, i'm not uptaded on the subject but given the importance and characteristics of women's reproductive system¹ being over-cautiion is, imho, is called for). the aspect of these vaccines that are common to all genetic constructs is the spike protein - they all (afaik) work by producing this protein but it's precisely the spike protein that can cross the blood-brain bareer and is citotoxic. 1) for those who don't know: women's reproductive cells are all there since birth and are more complex than men's cells. my preoccupation is that an exposure to something for a long time could damage those cells.",0.0,0

19061,"let’s make sure we are clear… this is not a vaccine. they are using the term “vaccine” to sneak this thing under public health exemptions. this is not a vaccine. this is mrna packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell. it is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator. it is not a vaccine. vaccines actually are a legally defined term under public health law; they are a legally defined term under cdc and fda standards.[1] and the vaccine specifically has to stimulate both the immunity within the person receiving it and it also has to disrupt transmission. and that is not what this is. they (moderna and pfizer) have been abundantly clear in saying that the mrna strand that is going into the cell is not to stop the transmission, it is a treatment. but if it was discussed as a treatment, it would not get the sympathetic ear of public health authorities because then people would say, “what other treatments are there? the use of the term vaccine is unconscionable for both the legal definition and also it is actually the sucker punch to open and free discourse… moderna was started as a chemotherapy company for cancer, not a vaccine manufacturer for sarscov2. if we said we are going to give people prophylactic chemotherapy for the cancer they don’t yet have, we’d be laughed out of the room because it’s a stupid idea. that’s exactly what this is. this is a mechanical device in the form of a very small package of technology that is being inserted into the human system to activate the cell to become a pathogen manufacturing site. and i refuse to stipulate in any conversations that this is in fact a vaccine issue. the only reason why the term is being used is to abuse the 1905 jacobson case that has been misrepresented since it was written. and if we were honest with this, we would actually call it what it is: it is a chemical pathogen device that is actually meant to unleash a chemical pathogen production action within a cell. it is a medical device, not a drug because it meets the cdrh definition of a device. it is not a living system, it is not a biologic system, it is a physical technology - it happens to just come in the size of a molecular package. so, we need to be really clear on making sure we don’t fall for their game. because their game is if we talk about it as a vaccine then we are going to get into a vaccine conversation but this is not, by their own admission, a vaccine. as a result it must be clear to everyone listening that we will not fall for this failed definition just like we will not fall for their industrial chemical definition of health. both of them are functionally flawed and are an implicit violation of the legal construct that is being exploited. i get frustrated when i hear activists and lawyers say, “we are going to fight the vaccine”. if you stipulate it’s a vaccine you’ve already lost the battle. it’s not a vaccine. it is made to make you sick. 80% of the people exposed to sarscov2 are asymptomatic carriers. 80% of people who get this injected into them experience a clinical adverse event. you are getting injected with a chemical substance to induce illness, not to induce an immuno-transmissive response. in other words, nothing about this is going to stop you from transmitting anything. this is about getting you sick and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick. when the paymaster for the distribution of information happens to be the industry that’s doing the distributing, we lose. because the only narrative is the one that will be compensated by the people writing the check. that goes for our politicians… and our media - it has been paid for - if you follow the money you realize there is no non-conflicted voice on any network."" - dr. david martin, jan 5th 2021.",0.0,0

27772,"the thing i am going to tell you is weird but a cure. it is my 20 years experience over pneumonia 🌈 a healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because this immunity doesn't work for long and second thing covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time third thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the other thing is. if covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. and next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world .actually it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. in some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. i make you sure that the patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation. believe or not we can resist our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. i am a patient of pneumonia myself and i was fed up of allopathic treatment but i followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today i am hundred percent healthy. i don't face pneumonia since last two years. there is no possible vaccine for corona and only ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. if someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. covid 19 can not harm him at any how . it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient would have eaten something already that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. if someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. the situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. i mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. i don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. i think patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. it means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. it is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. i am a patient of pneumonia and i have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so i discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. i have most sensitive body because if i eat an orange i get a body pain immediately and if i eat rice continously for four and five days i get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days i have faced corona and it took me 16 days to get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. i became weak my nose was running continuesly for four five days but i didn't face any mucus problem i have seen it. it was very dreadful but i saved my life because i am on the said diet already but if i won't have known this thing i would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. it takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (a healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.",0.0,0

15522,"if they're so safe and effective, why is old biden still walking around masked everywhere virtual signaling after taking it (a clean one he was given i'm sure, or possibly a saline solution). they can't deny the fact that there are no liability wavers they'll sign in case there are long term effects, and they can't deny there are zero long term studies or tests on their experimental gene therapy. how do these people know that splicing and inserting genes from things like jellyfish and putting into the human body has no unforeseen consequences. we don't know shit. natural antibodies ftw, that's all you need. especially in regards to a flu-like illness that barely affects 99% of people. don't forget old unhealthy trump survived it.",0.0,0

16890,"it will only take one of these variants to be able to 'get around' the immune response activated by the current vaccines, and the whole process will begin again from 'square one'. i think that is what is going to happen so they will have to constantly keep modifying the vaccines. it will mean years of lockdowns, masks, etc. what is really needed is a 'silver bullet' antiviral drug that knocks out the coronavirus type regardless of chemical structural changes in the spike protein. vaccines are inherently unreliable in a population of genetically altering viruses.",0.0,0
