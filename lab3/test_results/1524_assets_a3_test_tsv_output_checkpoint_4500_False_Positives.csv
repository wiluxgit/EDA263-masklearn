200,she is so confident that the science and statistical data is flawless when the science and statistical information has been skewed or incorrect this entire time. she needs to be more open minded to the possibility that these negative side effects might be happening at a much larger rate than what is being reported.,0,1

317,"as the parent of a vaccine-injured child, i have personal experience with what can happen. we've dealt with the repercussions for 15 years. so any possible vaccine side effects, injuries, or deaths should be very carefully studied, including blood work-up, before nonchalantly dismissing causal claims as ""absurd"" or ""conspiracy theories"".",0,1

961,"just a realistic point of view from a vaccine hesitant person (i am currently studying to be a nurse btw so understand how vaccines work) while i agree with most of what he said i'm still going to wait out as long as i can getting the vaccine. i think he downplayed the fact that you are still able to transmit the virus after vaccination, the window of time is reduced a fraction still and also still being able to contract covid after vaccination, given the vaccine isn't as effective on the delta strain. overall this reduces the protection it offers. also the long term effects. not one person can 100% say it's completely safe, not doctors, scientists, microbiologists, pfizer or the government know for sure. that is a matter of time. as far as data being collected it looks promising but i'm still just going to roll with natural immunity if i should contract covid. we have an immune system for a reason. my whole family abroad has had it, all 23 and they managed to survive without bad affect..even my 89 year old grandmother..was a bit rough on her but she got through it. anyone who says you'll turn into a lizard or it has microchips in the vaccine is just trolling that's not even a serious myth to debunk.",0,1

1042,i know quite a few black people who aren't going to get the vaccine. i happen to be one of them.,0,1
1047,i live in nh. my doctor tried talking me into the vaccine today i’m pregnant... they have no studies on how that would effect the baby or me 😂 she goes well we think it’s safe. y’all also thought the polio vaccine was safe and look how that worked out.,0,1

1441,"i'm still amazed how my mum got covid recently, ended up hospitalized (she's a risk group and had a bacterial lung coinfection), and all people seemed to ask were: but she did get all the vaccine doses? how easy it is to be brainwashed if you're not able to find or interpret ""reliable"" sources (this channel is gold for me). glad i was considered an antivxx (which i'm certainly not, exceptions include vxs in trial phase with unknown and possibly severe common side effects), and glad my sense making skills seem to have helped me once again. people, please don't inject your healthy little child with this, and trust in their amazing immune system, since it will do more harm than good.",0,1
